"My aunt lived in that area, and we were taken there daily. I can remember her telling me I was special and that I would be a star someday. That I had to do everything she said. Listen, practice.
My father was supposed to be watching my sister and me, but he would take us there and leave us with her. For part of that time we stayed with my aunt until we could get our own place. My father was supposed to be looking for work, but he would take off with my blood uncles every day, so it got to be that I never saw either parent for long periods of time. That would change on occasion when my father would take me with him to bars while he drank or played in a band or both. I would be at the bar with one of his girlfriends. It seemed perfectly natural to me.
My aunt began to sexually abuse me the first night. It continued the entire time we were there. Months. I didn't know until years later that my sister was locked in a closet while this went on.
Eventually we got a place of our own and the abuse stopped.
A few months later my cousins came to live with us and the sexual abuse started again. Just different people. It ended a few months later when they were caught. They had us tied up. The cords were tight. Not really cords at all, cloths line. My sister and I were tied back to back. My cousins, a sister and brother had already molested us for over an hour. I cannot recall where my mother was during that period of my life. She was gone a lot. I think she was working because he didn't work. That's all I know.

"Die Termine und Themen unseres Gruppenangebotes, der Ressourceninsel, im März stehen fest! 🌷🪺
 
❗️Wichtige Änderung in den Kommentaren❗️
 Bei der Atelier-Insel am Montag stehen kreativer Ausdruck, Gestaltung von individuellen Ideen und Experimente im Mittelpunkt. Das Gestalten in der Gruppe kann dabei sowohl unterstützend als auch ein Übungsfeld sein, sich im Gruppengeschehen zurechtzufinden. Die Themen sind als Input oder Vorschläge zu verstehen, denen du dich widmen kannst. Wer möchte, kann gerne eigene Ideen mitbringen oder in der Methodenbox stöbern.  Schwerpunkte der Gruppeninsel am Mittwoch sind Gespräche, Austausch und Übungen zu einem bestimmten Thema. Die Gruppeninsel soll dabei als Ressource (Austausch) dienen.  Die verbindliche Anmeldung für die Atelierinsel montags erfolgt bei Hissa Groth per E-Mail (gruppe@wildwasser-bielefeld.de) oder Telefon/SMS (0175 9270549). Für die Gruppeninsel mittwochs erfolgt die verbindliche Anmeldung über die Beratungsstelle per E-Mail (gruppe@wildwasser-bielefeld.de) oder telefonisch, auch über den Anrufbeantworter (0521 175476). Der Anmeldeschluss für die nächste folgende Woche ist Donnerstag, 17 Uhr. Es ist möglich sich direkt für mehrere Termine des Monats anzumelden.
Vor der erstmaligen Teilnahme an diesem Angebot ist ein Vorgespräch erforderlich. Dazu vereinbare bitte einen Termin. Beide Angebote sind offene Gruppen. Das bedeutet, Interessierte können sich immer wieder neu entscheiden, ob und wann sie an welcher Gruppe teilnehmen möchten. Die Teilnahme an beiden Angeboten ist auch abwechselnd möglich.   Die Gruppen-Insel am Mittwoch findet in unseren neuen Räumen in der Münzstraße 8 statt.    Detaillierte Informationen zu den Gruppenangeboten findest du unter:  ➡ www.wildwasser-bielefeld.de/ressourceninsel.html  🌊🌊🌊   #wildwasserbielefeld #wildwasser #bielefeld #liebefeld #ressourceninsel #ressourcengruppe #gruppeninsel #atelierinsel #traumasensiblegruppe #ressourcen #selbsthilfe #hilfezurselbsthilfe #gefühle #kraftquelle #selbstwert #stabilität #achtsamkeit #kunsttherapie #kreativität #gestaltung #beratung #hilfe #unterstützung #gegengewalt #gegensexualisiertegewalt #sexualisiertegewalt #beratungsstelle #metoo","[""#wildwasserbielefeld"",""#wildwasser"",""#bielefeld"",""#liebefeld"",""#ressourceninsel"",""#ressourcengruppe"",""#gruppeninsel"",""#atelierinsel"",""#traumasensiblegruppe"",""#ressourcen"",""#selbsthilfe"",""#hilfezurselbsthilfe"",""#gefühle"",""#kraftquelle"",""#selbstwert"",""#stabilität"",""#achtsamkeit"",""#kunsttherapie"",""#kreativität"",""#gestaltung"",""#beratung"",""#hilfe"",""#unterstützung"",""#gegengewalt"",""#gegensexualisiertegewalt"",""#sexualisiertegewalt"",""#beratungsstelle"",""#metoo""]",2024-02-28,1,5,0,"[""Achtung: Änderungen in 2024!\nLiebe Nutzer*innen der Ressourceninsel,\nwir freuen uns, dass es auch weiterhin so viel Interesse an der Gruppe gibt. Zu Beginn des Jahres möchten wir ein paar Veränderungen bekannt machen.\nMit Ende der Projektlaufzeit im August 2022 ist auch die Finanzierung der Ressourceninsel weggefallen. Wir müssen seitdem immer wieder neu schauen, wie wir die anfallenden Kosten decken können, zu einem Teil ist uns das in der Vergangenheit bereits durch Spenden gelungen. Darüber hinaus wird es ab Januar 2024 für die Teilnahme an der Atelier-Insel am Montag einen Unkostenbeitrag von 5 Euro pro Termin für Material und Raummiete geben. Im Atelier wird eine Spardose stehen, in die jede Person den Betrag einwerfen kann.\nWie einige bestimmt schon bemerkt haben, ist in den letzten Monaten vor allem an der Montagsgruppe das Interesse so groß gewesen, so dass sich viele über einen längeren Zeitraum nicht anmelden konnten. Uns ist es jedoch wichtig, dass möglichst viele (auch neue) Interessierte die Angebote regelmäßig nutzen können. Deshalb wird es auch Veränderungen bei der Anmeldung geben:\nPro Woche kann man sich für einen Gruppentermin, also entweder für den Montag oder den Mittwoch, anmelden.\nPro Monat kann man sich für maximal drei Termine der Montagsgruppe anmelden.""]",neutral

"There is a war. At home. If only someone knew? THESE ARE THE DOCUMENTS USED IN MY COURT CASE. 

MY other Facebook was shutdown after family court.

These documents of screenshots of my other Facebook that no longer exists are what was used to hand my kids to monsters. It’s pathetically unjustified. 

My Facebook is the biggest middle finger to my ex & the system. 

I can gage my ex’s stalking, rage, anger & find out all his moves from my new Facebook. I communicate through my social media. It’s the best thing I ever did. Now I have a new Facebook & it is the only place I communicate with my ex. I have control here. The only place you have control is their anger. Go towards the places you have control. It should be illegal for them to use this, but they will & I don’t care because I’m an American woman. 

I am gagged from even talking about domestic violence & family court corruption. It’s illegal for me to post pictures of my kids. So what? Let them make it illegal. I’m gunna show up & do what I want because this is the land of the free. Stop being scared stop telling me how to be. That’s rude. 

A judge refused to look at a single picture, video or medical records of my kids abuse. Years of documentation thrown out the window so I can be punished for nothing. Wake up. Turn your lights on. 

Family court is a joke. My gag order is completely unconstitutional & corrupt. 

Stop telling me what to post & not to post. I have already been there & done that. They’re gunna use if you sneeze against you. Stop giving into the excuse that I need to not show up so I won’t “get in trouble” so stupid. They already took my kids. I don’t have anything to lose.

"Remember this cover and the Me Too movement? It was 2017 and the ""silence breakers"" were Time's Person of the Year.

Time wrote: ""These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day.""

WHERE ARE THEY NOW? 

Mass rape on October 7th, mass rape of the hostages. Their silence is louder than any sound. 

If you know a Me Too pioneer or a silent celebrity, implore them to speak out. It is never too late.

"Et on commence ce compte avec mes lectures de janvier ! 📚❄️ 

Ce mois-ci j'ai découvert Kafka avec 'La métamorphose' et 'Lettre au père'... J'ai adoré le premier et son absurde mais le deuxième m'a un peu moins emportée, bien qu'il soit très profond et pousse à l'introspection... Certains sujets m'ont touchée mais d'autres m'étaient inconnus donc difficile de s'y attacher personnellement... 

Jordi Lafebre est mon auteur de bande dessinée préféré et 'Lydie' est le seul de ses livres que je n'avais pas encore. Dans 'Lydie', on suit la vie des habitants d'un même quartier dans lequel Lydie a perdu son enfant mort-né. Cependant, tous les habitants jouent le jeu de faire comme si l'enfant avait vécu, ce qui le rend presque réel... Le seul défaut que je peux trouver à cette bd, c'est qu'elle est beaucoup trop courte 🥲 mais encore une fois c'est un plaisir de parcourir ses pages et le duo Jordi Lafebre/Zidrou fonctionne toujours aussi bien. 

'Max' de Sarah Cohen-Scali est un roman historique dans lequel on suit le parcours du premier enfant du programme du Lebensborn et toute son évolution de pensée sur le fascisme. Ce livre m'a bouleversée, m'a fait pleurer et m'a laissée pantoise... Il est très intéressant et très bien documenté si vous aimez l'histoire allez-y les yeux fermés ! 

'Moi aussi, MeToo au delà du hashtag' est un livre dans lequel des personnalités féminines francophones reviennent sur la manière dont elles ont vécu le hashtag MeToo et l'impact qu'il a eu sur leur vie.  Je l'ai lu un peu tard puisqu'il est sorti a l'occasion des 5 ans de MeToo mais il a quand même résonné en moi et c'est une lecture marquante et importante dans l'objectif de déconstruction. 

Et vous, lesquels avez-vous lus ? ❄️

"What does it really mean when you invite someone back to your place? 
It means that you invite them back to your place. Nothing More. 
Saying yes to go to someone's place doesn't equal or even imply consent to any sexual activity. 
It also doesn't mean anyone owes anyone anything.

"Many of us have seen bullying behavior at work. And though we might not like to admit it, many of us have failed to do anything about it.

That can reflect the difficult trade-offs that come with calling out bullying. In this episode of the Chicago Booth Review Podcast, Booth’s John Paul Rollert reflects on “the precarious relationship between ethics and expediency” when it comes to blowing the whistle on workplace bullying.

"Har I set en masse nævne Martin Thorborg og hans holdning til mænds mistrivsel? ⁠
⁠
Vi har fundet og lyttet til podcasten, hvor Martin Thorborg giver sit interessante take på kønsdebatten, og lyttet til den, så I ikke behøver. 🤮⁠
⁠
Martin vader simpelthen ind i sine egne pointer. Hans ⁠
kvinder mod mænd' tilgang er et tydeligt bevis på, at rigtig mange mænd (Martin inklusiv) mangler et sprog for det at tale om køn. Martin får nemlig, i sin forklaring på hvordan nogle mænd kan lide Andrew Tate,  sagt at han nærmest godt forstår dem og at det er kvinders skyld, fordi vi er blevet for succesfulde.⁠
⁠
Det hører med til historien, at Martins kommentarer er en meget lille del af en meget lang podcast, så vi googlede lige lidt rundt, for at tjekke, om Martin måske bare havde fået forvildet sig ud i denne debat ved et uheld. ⁠
⁠
Men vi faldt faktisk over flere guldkorn derude, blandt andet en artikel fra 2018, hvor Martin fortæller, at #metoo ikke påvirker ham, da han ved fra sin ekskone (der er politibetjent), at rigtig mange kvinder lyver om voldtægter, fordi de har fortrudt at de har været deres partner utro. Så...🫣","[""#metoo""]",2024-02-25,72,1973,0,"[""Det er sjovt at sige verden er indrettet til kvinder. Hvis det var rigtigt så kan vi sige vi tager de næste 5000 år efter verden har været indrettet efter mænd. Og derefter kan vi se hvad vi gør."",""Det er interessant at høre om den podcast med Martin vidste slet ikke den eksisterede! Jeg er gift med en mand som undre sig over hvorfor mænd,  ikke bare er mænd soe har lyst til at være ? Hvis mænd tuder nu over ligestilling som jo slet ikke er i mål, hvad så med slet den tid hvor kvinder ikke havde plads?  Hvad er det de unge mænd spejler sig i, hvad er det de mener der mangler eller gør de det til en konkurrence som giver bagslag ift. At kvinder giver dem baghjul ? Måske er jeg gammel og derfor ikke forstår det."",""❤❤❤"",""Undrer mig. Vidste ikke han var sådan...😮iøvrigt kunne oplevelsen af at kvinder har fået (lidt) mere magt og følelsen af dette jo anspore til refleksion over hvordan det må have været for kvinderne. Han misforstår vist at vi har så meget magt pt. Tror det er hans frygt for at miste magt der taler."",""👏👏"",""🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥""]",negative

"Listen to Anna, a survivor of teen dating violence. She’s courageously telling us what we need to hear, not only during Teen Dating Awareness Month #TDVAM, as @thefeministparent explains in her latest reel (check it out).

As a freshman, Anna was “instantly hooked” by a varsity athlete who made her feel great—until he didn’t. Read her @womensmediacenter story via our highlights or linktree.

Anna wants people to learn the warning signs of teen dating and how to get help. She recommends @sashclubs “Teen Dating Violence” Power Topic presentation, via our Power Topics highlight or linktree.

Like many survivors of abuse by male athletes, she found it pointless to report because the school ignored victims. If Anna’s school had supported reporting students, she could have avoided years of trauma. Schools must create a safe environment for all students, take reports compassionately, and act quickly to stop the harassment. Too often schools don’t--so students are denied their right to an education free from sexual harassment as guaranteed by Title IX, a federal civil rights law.

Use @ssaisorg toolkits (in our highlights) to ensure your school is taking the required steps to protect students.

"✨ Setting and respecting boundaries is vital in any relationship so that all partners feel safe communicating their needs without fear of retaliation. Healthy relationships involve comfortable dialogues around wants, goals, fears, and limits, with the understanding that everyone's expressed boundaries will be honored. Boundaries can come in many different forms: 

🧠 Emotional: Trust and comfort are essential in a healthy relationship that partners build over time by demonstrating reliability.

✋ Physical: Partners know how far the other wants to go based on open communication. Your boundaries should always reflect how ready you feel personally.

💻 Digital: You and your partner should feel able to discuss your needs and wants. Remember: changes to the terms should be made together with respect.

🗯️ Conflict: Conflict is normal, but your arguments shouldn’t turn into personal attacks. If you can’t express yourself without fear of retaliation, you may be experiencing abuse.

Follow @loveisrespectofficial and visit ➡️ https://www.loveisrespect.org/everyone-deserves-a-healthy-relationship/how-to-set-boundaries/ for more information on setting boundaries for a healthy relationship.

"Trigger warning - unpopular opinion...

As a psychologist, wellness coach, and human being, I often feel like the world/society is moving in the exact opposite direction than what I'm doing and what my worldview is.

From the #metoo movement, to #democracy, from #healthcare in general to #conspiracytheory and so many more topics... I have a fundamentalky different opinion than the overall concesus seems to be.

I feel the world/society has gotten ridiculous! We've gone absolutely mad as a species. And yes, that is my professional opinion.

I see so many people being confused about their basic identity, people being overly sensitive and expecting everyone around them to take their specific preferences and possible triggers into account (which, by the way are different for each individual AND not the world's responsibility), doctors having no clue about actual health care, people being offered the option to get euthanized simply because main stream therapists don't have the holistic knowledge and experience to treat people properly. We're being co-erced and gaslit into taking experimental shots, with no liability of the manufacturers. We're being led to believe that there is a climate crisis that can be stopped by cutting off our food supply (farmers) and replace it with artifial meat and such, while formula 1 continues.

I mean, come on! 

Your health, your triggers, your decisions, healing from trauma, finding the right therapists and doctors for YOU, creating safety... is YOUR responsibility. No one else's. It's time to take your power back!! Because the world  needs you happy, healthy, and thriving, not constantly in survival mode from trying to fit into a profoundly sick society. The world needs your contribution, not your whining. The world needs you to shine bright, so everything that is lurking in the shadows can come to the surface and dissipate.

I'll keep empowering my clients as much as I can. Because I believe that is the road to a better world. Inspiring people to take the reigns of their lives and make heartfelt decisions that are aligned with their true being.

"I firmly believe that challenges are opportunities in disguise, presenting us with valuable lessons and insights to grow from. Instead of dwelling on the unfairness of a situation, I choose to channel my energy into understanding how I can emerge stronger and wiser. Shifting one’s perspective from victimhood to empowerment can be transformative. Every setback becomes a stepping stone, propelling us forward on our journey. Despite the trials I’ve faced, I refuse to be defined by them; rather, I am defined by my resilience and determination to overcome. It’s this mindset that has enabled me to navigate life’s tumultuous waters and emerge triumphant, time and time again.

"Just sharing another shot from Saturday night because it’s all still sinking in. And I should share the hell out of the pics. It was a huge undertaking, doing my own show. Today, in a cafe, I had a lovely lady stop me and tell me she was there, and throughly enjoyed it! How bizarre is that.

I like this one because @norbertdrebin74 and I look a little more thoughtful, more serious. Because of course there were laughs, but it was also an intense show, and very personal. I had to be very vulnerable. We both did.

I’ve been exhausted this week. But that’s understandable. I was out of my comfort zone. But I’m so glad I did it.

Hombre que mató al violador de su hijo en vivo por televisión y salió libre

El hombre le disparó al violador en la cabeza desde un metro de distancia, quien murió al día siguiente. 

El hombre recibió un amplio apoyo del público estadounidense por el asesinato por venganza.

""Creo que para muchas personas que no están satisfechas con el sistema de justicia estadounidense, mi padre es un símbolo de justicia"", dijo el chico sobre su padre. ""Mi padre hizo lo que todos dicen que harían, pero sólo unos pocos lo han hecho. En cuanto a arrepentimiento, por supuesto que se arrepiente de todo lo que pasó, pero nunca se arrepintió de su acción"".

Man who killed his son's rapist live on TV and walked free

The man shot the rapist in the head from three feet away, he died the next day.

The man was widely supported by the American public over the revenge killing.

""I think for a lot of people who have not been satisfied by the American justice system my dad stands as a symbol of justice"", said the guy about his father. ""My dad did what everybody says what they would do yet only few have done it. As far as regret, of course he regrets the whole thing happened but he never regretted his action"".

"More of this shit! I’ve had male colleagues take my iPhone whilst I would leave it on the table as I went to the loo, and despite being locked, they would access the camera to take “dick pics” and record a video essentially mocking me for “sleeping with them last night”. Obviously untrue and can be proven so!  It’s not just the medical industry, the aviation industry treats women with disdain and contempt and subjects them to sex harrassment and sex discrimination.  All whilst hiding behind their “ethics policies” which surmounts to victimisation too.

Oh and it should be noted that because these photos and videos were taken without my consent on my personal iPhone, apples iCloud would sync them across all of my Apple devices for family to see!

 #167 Pasión por rescatar(se). Soraya

¿Qué tiene que pasar en nuestras vidas para comprender que necesitamos ser rescatados? ¿qué tiene que pasar para que comprendamos que el rescate tiene que ser por nosotros mismos?

Hoy conocemos a Soraya, una mujer que le da una connotación diferente al término “me salve” , cuando no hay nadie quien te tienda la mano, pues te toca salir sola del hoyo, mientras buscas a esas personas quete ayuden, que estén ahí, que estén pendientes de algo tan cotidiano como si llegaste bien a casa.

Si hay forma de seguir viviendo, no solo de sobrevivir.

"Teen dating violence takes many forms including psychological aggression: verbal or non-verbal communication to emotionally harm or control another person. It can also include repeated, unwanted attention or contact (like intrusively checking emails and texts) that causes fear or concern for one’s own safety. The many warning signs are included in our Teen Dating Violence Power Topic (via highlights). It offers a fast-moving video “Dating Abuse: Toolkit for Talking to Teens” with scenarios for people of all genders created by @jewishwomenintl. Thanks for collaborating, CEO

Für die Mitarbeitenden gibt es nur zwei Optionen: Entweder ertragen oder gehen. Doch offen wird darüber kaum geredet, denn viel zu groß ist die Angst vor Konsequenzen. 

Ich habe genau jene Erlebnisse gesammelt, die sich in deutschen Unternehmen hinter verschlossenen Türen abspielen und erzähle sie euch in meinem Buch “Das Ende toxischer Männlichkeit”. Lasst uns gemeinsam Missstände aufdecken, wo sie herrschen, und den Finger in die Wunde legen. 

Kurzum: Lasst uns hinsehen – auch wenn es weh tut. Denn nur so können wir etwas verändern.

""إننا نشعر بالأسى بشكل خاص إزاء التقارير التي تفيد بأن النساء والفتيات الفلسطينيات المحتجزات تعرضن أيضًا لأشكال متعددة من الاعتداء الجنسي، مثل تجريدهن من ملابسهن وتفتيشهن من قبل ضباط الجيش الإسرائيلي الذكور."" وقال الخبراء إن ما لا يقل عن معتقلتين فلسطينيتين تعرضتا للاغتصاب بينما ورد أن أخريات تعرضن للتهديد بالاغتصاب والعنف الجنسي. وأشاروا أيضًا إلى أن صور المعتقلات في ظروف مهينة قد التقطها الجيش الإسرائيلي ونشرها على الإنترنت.
وأعرب الخبراء عن قلقهم إزاء التقارير التي تفيد بأن عدداً غير معروف من النساء والأطفال الفلسطينيين، بما في ذلك الفتيات، قد اختفوا بعد الاتصال بالجيش الإسرائيلي في غزة. 

UN News Report 
“We are particularly distressed by reports that Palestinian women and girls in detention have also been subjected to multiple forms of sexual assault, such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army officers. At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly raped while others were reportedly threatened with rape and sexual violence,” the experts said.
Photos of women detainees in degrading circumstances were also “reportedly taken by the Israeli army” and uploaded online, they added. 
The experts were also concerned that an unknown number of Palestinian women and children, including girls, have reportedly gone missing after contact with the Israeli army in Gaza.

"Touch is something that comes up whenever we talk about intimacy. How we view touch as men is often skewed by homophobia and patriarchal ideas of sexualisation and domination. 

So many societies around the world have a different relationship with masculine intimacy, not to say that they are perfect, but from a western perspective, we are lacking.

What are your thought on male touch? How can we regain our sense of love and appreciation in platonic, non sexual ways?

"The group home racket epitomizes abuse.
Justin Salvio oversees a forced prostitution ring, Gilead Community ""Services"", and I tried to rescue a victim; so he arranged for a crooked cop to rape her and prevent her from running away again. He also disrespected my family by lying to my mother. What's next, desecrating burial grounds?
Crooked cop Andrew Lindberg rapes an #autistic woman and forces her to defend the predators she has repeatedly ran away from.

The predators' main office is at 222 Main Street Extension Middletown Connecticut 06457

They're planning a rally to advertise abuse on April 7th 2024.

The victim is forced to defend  Gilead Community ""Services""  after running away and seeking my help. She described that group home as ""like a concentration camp"" and now she's forced to claim she ""would have died without Gilead"". She's forcibly drugged and had gallstones at 37.

今天來介紹的是妨害性自主中的性交罪

妨害性自主罪主要可以分為「性交」與「猥褻」
差別在於任意一方之性器是否接合
（包含口交、指交、肛交）

本篇為說明性交罪的部分
根據不同違犯對方意願的型式共分為—
強制性交、乘機性交、權勢猥褻、
詐術性交、及準強制猥褻

若要對加害者提吿，請務必針對相對應的罪刑提出告訴
假設加害者實際上是「乘機性交」
但告訴人為了讓對方被法律重重制裁
而要求檢察官對當事人提起「強制性交」的告訴
很可能最後會因為引述錯誤的法源而獲不起訴的結果
那不代表加害者沒有錯、不代表台灣法律只保護壞人

而是法律只保護懂法律的人。

"“But the idea of parental alienation has come under scrutiny in recent years, as women and domestic violence experts have increasingly pointed out that claims of parental alienation often involve cases that stem from domestic abuse resulting in the allegedly abused parent being naturally resistant to allowing the abusive ex-partner to continue parenting the child. Divorced women are claiming they are encouraged by attorneys not to mention domestic violence in their court proceedings for fear of a claim of parental alienation being used against them in custody proceedings.

Studies have shown that when a claim of parental alienation is made, courts increasingly side with the alienated party and often reverse custody orders, returning children to an abusive parent. A 2023 report to the United Nations, labeled parental alienation a “pseudo-concept” that endangers the lives of women and children. The idea of parental alienation as a psychological disorder has also come under heavy scrutiny by other psychologists.”

There is a war at home. If only someone knew? 

❤️🤍💙 🤫❤️‍🩹💔

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"My name is #PatriciaDouglas

""The Patricia Douglas case is probably the biggest, best-suppressed scandal in Hollywood history."" Vanity Fair.

Take a look at the story that inspired the show and the character of #GirlNextDoor played by @yorkshirewade

Trigger Warning: Themes of sexual assault.

On the evening of May 5, 1937, a 20-year-old Patricia Douglas was brought to work at an MGM party, under the guise of a casting call, with more than 120 other young women.

Herded into a large banquet hall, they were ordered to sit at tables and wait. Studio bosses, assorted MGM bigwigs, male stars, and almost 300 revved-up conventioneers appeared.

Given that they had been promised a stag affair, the salesmen’s lust-at-first-sight response to a bevy of young, over-made-up beauties makes sad and terrible sense. Delegates mistook the girls for party favors and treated them accordingly; without telephones or transportation, the young women had no means of escape. Tricked into attendance, then trapped into service, they were left to fend for themselves.

Patricia Douglas was one of the first people to come forward after experiencing sexual assault in the film industry, leading to a massive scandal that MGM minimized by a smear campaign. In what was a legal first Patricia Douglas was the first female plaintiff to make rape a federal case based on her civil rights.

"小學二年級遇見那個暴露狂的時候，他拿著一個手帕，說需要我和堂姊幫忙，堂姊有點害怕，但我仗著認為工地附近是自己從小長大的地盤，於是我說，好。他帶我們走到工地深處無人之境，要我跟堂姊各持手帕一角，接著開始朝手帕打手槍。

他的陰莖，紅紅紫紫，血管與陰毛爬上那隻肉棍，我從來沒有看過人體有這種部位，簡直奇觀，醜到難以忘懷。他呻吟，他射在手帕上，接著他用手帕擦乾淨，跟我們道謝，「這個東西沒弄出來就不舒服，你們長大也會這樣！」
 
然後我長大了。我沒有像暴露狂所預言長出陰莖還會射精，但是我無法擺脫對男體的醜陋印象，對性的歧想，發育時胸部長出來的時候我只想吐，然後我花了整個青春期的時間還是無法參透自己是不是同性戀因為我無法解釋為何男生向我告白時我只覺得噁心，然後我剃了平頭、買了男裝、學習講粗話、走路大搖大擺只為了讓自己像一個真正的男孩，然後當我遇見愛情卻永遠會反覆質疑自己是不是哪裡有毛病？我不應該對男生動心，我怎麼可能愛上男生？男生怎麼可能愛我？
 
我怎麼可能愛我自己？

到現在我還是不知道怎麼去當一個女人，或怎麼去當一個人。我等待時間使我釋懷，但時間稀釋的只有記憶，不是感覺。

Thirty something Vanessa Wye is working a dead end job as a hotel concierge. Dealing with the loss of her father and the slow decline of her once bright academic future, she has sunk into a cycle of alcohol and drugs, just barely managing to keep her head above water. 

At the height of #MeToo, her high school teacher, Jacob Strane, is accused of sexually abusing several girls. This brings back long buried memories of Vanessa’s own troubled relationship with Strane. 
.
𝙍𝙚𝙫𝙞𝙚𝙬:
🥀 The two timelines - one by a jaded adult Vanessa and the other by the optimistic 15 year old who has a crush on 42 year old English teacher - make for a brilliant and poignant contrast.

🥀 I loved Vanessa’s character progression from a flirty teen to an abused, brainwashed young woman and then to an adult whose life is shaped (and destroyed) by that abuse. I found adult Vanessa’s weird obsessive love/hate relationship with Strane very interesting.

🥀 Strane is obviously despicable and manipulative, but looking at him from Vanessa’s POV still manages to muddy the lens you view him through. This is a testament to how well Vanessa is written. 

🥀 I won’t lie. This book was deeply disturbing and difficult to read.

"#FromTheArchive | It was January 2019, the time around which an international movement called #MeToo was gaining prominence in India. #MeToo was a soc­ial-media-driven campaign that started in 2017, when women across the globe started speaking up against sexual harassment, insp­i­red by American activist and rape survivor Tar­ana Burke. In India, #MeToo began with all­e­gations by and against Bollywood celebrit­ies, and gathered steam on social media. As a result, small towns and rural India remained blissfully unaware.

But for many women, it is not easy to speak up, especially in rural areas where conservative and regressive mores automatically tend to put the blame on women who speak up.

Mayank Jain Parichha writes.

Note: Ahead of Women’s Day, Outlook looks back at its archive stories on women who are unapologetic about who they are.

"Even in healthy relationships without abuse, communication can be difficult and we may escalate conflict by not using the best communication skills. When someone else’s actions evoke an upsetting emotional response within us, how can we communicate this?

A common communication error is when we use an accusatory or blame statement. In these statements, we say something such as, “You don’t care about me,” or “You’re mad at me right now.” When we say these statements, we are telling the other person what their intentions or feelings are, when in reality, what we are trying to communicate is what emotions come up for us when something happens.

Try the “I feel… when you… I wish… because” sentence structure. By using this structure, we address our feelings and don’t make the other person responsible for them. We also explain what about it evoked this emotional response and how you both can navigate the issue in the future.

Remember: emotions just are. No one is to blame for them, not ourselves nor our partner. While we may not have full control over what emotions we experience, we have control over how we respond to them. Additionally, please keep in mind that this communication strategy does not apply in abusive relationships. If you feel like your relationship is abusive, please contact the Domestic Violence Hotline at:

"Love bombing is a manipulation tactic for control, used in abusive relationships and by those with insecure attachment seeking power. It is when, primarily at the beginning of a relationship, your partner “bombs” you with extreme displays of affection and attention in order to manipulate you.

We often hear about the “honeymoon phase” in relationships where, typically at the beginning of the relationship, partners are more affectionate and give more focus to the relationship than normal. How do we know the difference? 

In love bombing, it’s a cycle. They start by showering you with affection, but quickly switch to denying you love and attention as a way to manipulate you into doing things to get that attention back. In the honeymoon phase, you will begin to display more normal levels of attention and affection slowly and gradually overtime as the newness of the relationship wears off. Love and affection is not withheld in an attempt to receive something in return.

"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Petit ouvrage pépite dévoré en 2 jours.

« Le consentement » de Vanessa Springora @vanessa.springora 

Quel courage il a fallu à l’autrice pour l’écrire. Avec quel brio elle raconte cette emprise que peut avoir un adulte sur un enfant de 14, 15 puis 16 ans.

On est dans sa peau, sa peau d’enfant regardée et flattée, qui a si soif d’amour et d’aventure, qu’elle hurlerait évidemment son consentement (si on le lui demandait).

Mais cela s’appelle de la pédophilie.

Et notre rôle d’adulte c’est aussi de protéger les enfants d’eux mêmes et de leurs désirs.

Car cette emprise basée sur le déséquilibre ne peut glisser que vers la cruauté, la dégradation, l’enfermement, l’abus. Un enfant et un adulte ne jouent pas avec les mêmes règles, les actes et les mots n’ont pas les mêmes sens pour eux. Il n’y a qu’avec son regard d’adulte que l’enfant pourra comprendre plus tard ce qui s’est joué.

Horreur de constater que cela est vécu au grand jour, que le prédateur (qui est écrivain) s’en vante dans son œuvre ou sur des plateaux tv. Et personne ne dit rien, ne fait rien.

Une mère qui laisse faire, un père absent, des amis de la mère qui réagissent parfois bien que très mollement, une époque permissive… Voici la petite V. jetée en pâture, qui a la force de piéger l’agresseur à son propre piège : en l’enfermant dans un livre!! 

J’espère que l’autrice arrive à ressentir aujourd’hui sa force et sa victoire. Je les ressens tellement en refermant ce livre.

PS : Je n’ai pas encore vu le film tiré de ce livre, mais la série « icon of french cinema » de Judith Godrèche @judithgodreche1 qui aborde entre autre le même thème est canon!! Je vous la conseille vivement.

"Ich bin Mama und Krankenschwester, habe 2 Jobs, 2 wundervolle Kinder, 2 flauschige Zwerghasen, 6 Terrorhühnchen und 7 Katzen die  zu unserer Familie gehören. Ich habe ein Haus, einen großen Garten, Hobbies, wie Musik, Schreiben und alles zu fotografieren was mir gefällt, sei es ein kleiner Käfer, eine schwarze Nackschnecke, den 100. Regenbogen, das 100000 Bild meiner Lütten oder das 1 Mio. Katzenfoto.
Ich muss nebenbei auch den ganzen Erwachenenkram erledigen. Rechnungen bezahlen, Versicherungen vergleichen, mich ums Auto kümmern, Reparaturen die ums Haus und im Haus anstehen erledigen oder finanzieren. Putzen, Kochen, Wäsche machen, Hausaufgaben support leisten, Taxifahrer spielen, und so vieles mehr. Ich bin mir sicher viele von euch kennen das. Immer mehr von euch sind auch Alleinerziehend und an euch richtet sich der Post vorwiegend. Egal wie hart oder aussichtslos es manchmal scheint, wie oft ihr aufgeben wollt, wie oft ihr abends allein auf der Couch sitzt und weint um den Gefühlsballast loszuwerden, Tatsache ist, es gibt den nächsten Tag.
 Den nächsten Tag an dem alles besser laufen kann, ein Tag an dem ihr auch um Hilfe bitten könnt wenn ihr alleine gerade einfach keine Kraft mehr habt und ihr nicht wisst wo euch der Kopf steht. Für manchen ist es ein schwerer Schritt und ihr habt Angst Schwäche zu zeigen, aber das ist es eben nicht. Um Hilfe bitten ist ein Zeichen von Stärke.
Und dann wird der ganze Ballast auf mehreren Schultern getragen und du kannst wieder atmen und dein Leben genießen.

"Si replica dopo il sold out 1,2,3 marzo al Teatro Lo Spazio. "" Una quantità di umorismo e ironia, una varietà di toni e ritmi, una tale vitalità che ci si può solo augurare che sia visto da molti più spettatori di quelli che ne hanno avuto finora la fortuna."" Franco Cordelli - Il Corriere della sera-
“Non abbiamo semplicemente e assistito ad uno spettacolo... il pubblico è stato coinvolto, rispondendo alle domande... sorseggiando un bicchierino di whiskey… fino a lasciarsi andare ad una standing ovation con gli occhi velati di lacrime….conferma una grande artista... scrittrice, regista e coinvolgente interprete dei suoi personaggi e del suo ""fare teatro"" che ormai porta in scena con grande successo di pubblico e che noi apprezziamo ogni volta. Dopo l'enorme successo ottenuto lo spettacolo replicherà nuovamente al teatro Lo Spazio dal 1 al 3 marzo 2024”Silvia Scalamonti- Il FoyerTestimonianze sconvolgenti, ricordi e falsi ricordi si susseguono attraverso immagini e linguaggi schietti, una sorta di valzer tormentato dove a ballare sono i confini tra realtà e finzione…l’attrice si spoglia di tutte le sue maschere. Una sorta di strip-tease dell’anima per liberarsi di un pudore inutile e soffocante e, finalmente, urlare le sue verità"".
Marilisa Pendino  - Teatro.it   
...un teatro, per una sera tornato ad essere spazio di verità. Ecco c’è chi passa il tempo a mostrare teatro, chi si affanna coraggiosamente a farlo, poi qualcuno ci ricorda che non c’è modo di mostrare o fare, se ci si dimentica di essere. 
Simone Nebbia- Teatro e Critica 
“Patrizia Schiavo con il suo “Donne senza censura” abbatte il muro del silenzio, delle ipocrisie e del perbenismo di una società che ci vuole solo a determinate condizioni."" 
Chiara di Pietro - Saltinaria
“Attrice intensa e fortemente evocativa, espande le sue emozioni e contagia il pubblico. Lo fa ridere, lo fa commuovere, lo punzecchia anche, senza mai lasciarlo indifferente. Assieme alle due bravissime colleghe mette in scena uno spettacolo…assolutamente da vedere sia per il tema trattato che per la straordinaria performance.”

"Domestic violence advocating looks like different things & one of the best ways to show up & advocate for those in abuse is to just show up to be seen.

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"Para ver el arcoíris no necesitas esperar a la tormenta. ✨

Esta fue la metáfora que mi 🧠 hizo después de ver este maravilloso espectáculo de la naturaleza sin tener que pasar una 🌧️ torrencial antes. Alguna vez me dije que el dolor me hacía crecer, que me fortalecía pero ahora podría agregar que pasar el mismo dolor una y otra vez ya no fortalece al contrario, podría volverse tan natural que ya no se diferenciaría del que realmente te vuelve resiliente. 

A los 18 años fui por primera vez a terapia para hablar y dejar de sufrir por lo mismo después de reconocer la raíz de lo que me dolía o enfermaba y hoy caí en cuenta que ya son 10 años desde ese pacto: sanar&amarme por el resto de mis días.

"Repost: @noustoutes.06 

Une grève féministe mérite bien une superbe manifestation non ? Et bien c’est ce que nous vous avons préparé pour le vendredi 8 mars prochain, à 11h à Nice. On organise tout ça avec les orga locales du @collectifdroitsdesfemmes06

"🧡 This February, we’re going orange for Teen Dating Violence Awareness Month! Our passionate SafeHouse staff is wearing orange to raise awareness about teen relationship abuse and show support for every young person and their right to healthy relationships full of trust and respect. 

Orange represents our hope for a future free of violence, along with our commitment to empowering teens with support and education. 📙

By wearing this vibrant color, we’re sending a message that teen dating violence has no place in our community. Together, we can promote safe, caring relationships for all youth. Going orange for TDVAM is just one small action - but it represents the bold change we strive for!

"La ceremonia, que se celebra en el Teatro Olympia de París, está condicionada por las denuncias de las actrices Judith Godrèche e Isild Le Besco contra los directores Benoît Jacquot y Jacques Doillon.
El cine francés celebra este viernes su gala anual, los premios César, atormentado nuevamente por denuncias de violencia sexual, esta vez de actrices que eran menores cuando fueron supuestamente víctimas de directores abusivos. La tempestad del movimiento #MeToo no ha amainado en Francia, sino todo lo contrario, y la nueva oleada de acusaciones es liderada por la actriz Judith Godrèche (51 años), acompañada en un segundo plano por Isild Le Besco (41). Ambas acusan a los cineastas Benoît Jacquot y Jacques Doillon de haber ejercido un auténtico “dominio” psicológico sobre ellas hace décadas, cuando empezaban en el mundo del cine.

“Anatomía de una caída” y la (re)interpretación del relato
Godrèche fue pareja de Jacquot después de rodar bajo sus órdenes Les mendiants en 1986. La joven se fue a vivir con él cuando tenía 15 años, sin que sus padres supuestamente objetaran nada. Él tenía 39 (actualmente 77). Esa relación fue vivida ante los ojos de la opinión pública, durante seis años, y en particular del cine francés y de los platós televisivos, donde ambos se prodigaron.

Godrèche denuncia ahora a su expareja de “violación” y de ser un “depredador”; él asegura que todo es falso y que fue él quien cayó bajo su “poder”.

Godréche filmó también bajo las órdenes de Doillon cuando aún era menor, como sucedió años después con Isild Le Besco. Esta actriz mantuvo también una corta relación con Benoît Jacquot cuando tenía 16. Jacquot, asegura Isild Le Besco, la trató de “gorda” y la sometió a una relación abusiva y dominadora.

"In honour of Black History Month, Black Excellence: A Heritage to Celebrate; a Future to Build, SSAIC would like to recognize Mikki Kendall. 

Mikki Kendall is the author of a New York Times bestseller, Hood Feminism: Notes from the Women That a Movement Forgot, as well as many liberating and profound essays published in platforms such as TIME, the New York Times, The Guardian, the Washington Post, Vogue, and many others. 

Kendall has worn many hats in the span of her career but her focus throughout has surrounded topics of feminism, race, diversity and representation. 

In her book, Hood Feminism, Kendal expresses her activism for women of colour by criticizing the feminist movement for being largely ""the province of the privileged"" and ignoring problems that disproportionately impact communities of color, including poverty, housing, medical care, and racism. 

The book stands as an essential tool for particularly white women to utilize. This book allow's women of privilege a lens into understanding the impacts of intersectionality and its effects. Kendall draws on her own experiences of hunger, violence, and hypersexualization, to shine a light on a movement that chronically fails to address the needs of all but a few women. 

Kendall's book is a fierce and necessary step towards acknowledging intersectionality and abolishing the line between women experiencing it and those that are privileged enough no to, within a movement essential to all. 

To learn more about Mikki Kendal and her works, check out her website at https://mikkikendall.com/ or scroll through her Instagram @karnythia.

Le saviez-vous ⁉️ Le prénom Daphné vient du grec et signifie Laurier ! Dans la mythologie grecque, le père de Daphné l'aurait transformée en laurier afin de tromper Apollon, fou amoureux d'elle et la poursuivant sans relâche. En langage de 2024, Apollon, c'est un vrai stalker en fait #metoo

Pas facile à faire pousser ce petit arbuste, mais le jeu en vaut la chandelle car son parfum intense et sa jolie floraison intervient très tôt dans l'année et dure longtemps de février à mars ! 🌸🌸🌸

Sa famille, les Thyméléacées, n'est pas très courante, on y retrouve d'autres plantes très parfumées comme l'étonnant Edgeworthia. Cette famille est notamment connue pour la présence de fibre dans leur bois, utile pour la fabrication de papier 📜🗞️

"#比鬼還恐怖的鬼故事002

《真正逼我走上絕路的不是性侵犯，而是同儕的霸凌和被檢討的聲音》—2009｜台北市某公立國高中

故事主角和我們分享的幾項人生準則：

1.遠離那些試圖以八卦拉近彼此關係的人
當你身上不再具有吸引對方的特質或利益時
你就會成為對方口中拿來認識新朋友的籌碼

2.眼見不一定為憑、耳聽不一定為真
實際相處、用心感受，對任何事不要太快下定論

3.不要過度在乎他人的眼光，那很痛苦
把心力投注在自我成長，不要過度向外索取認同

But first I'm taking off the top of my skull and muddling all my brains around into soup so that NO ONE can capitalize on my creativity. Y'all lost your chance
Keep on going with the misogyny and disrespect, it's worked for you so far huh NASA?

"Vortrag: Antisemitismus in feministischen und queeren Bewegungen

Freitag, 01.03.2024, 19:00 Uhr, Café Median (Niklotstraße 5/6, Rostock)

Wem feministische Solidarität gilt und wer davon ausgeschlossen ist, mussten Jüdinnen und israelische Frauen nach dem Massaker der Hamas am 7. Oktober 2023 bitter erfahren: Für sie galt die Grundüberzeugung der #MeToo-Bewegung nicht. Stattdessen formierte sich weltweit eine antisemitische Allianz, die die Gräueltaten der Hamas entweder leugnete oder rechtfertigte. Ausgerechnet emanzipatorische Kämpfe werden schon seit Jahren zunehmend zu Schauplätzen antisemitischer Verschwörung und antizionistischer Vernichtungsdrohungen. Im Vortrag sollen diese Phänomene der vergangenen Jahre und insbesondere der vergangenen Monate, ihre Ursprünge und Argumentationen genauer unter die Lupe genommen werden.“

Merle Stöver ist Antisemitismusforscherin. Sie referiert, schreibt und forscht zu Antiziganismus, Antisemitismus, Sozialchauvinismus und Geschlechterverhältnissen. Zuletzt veröffentlichte sie dazu im Buch Judenhass Underground und der Jungle World.","[""#MeToo-Bewegung""]",2024-02-28,1,89,0,"[""Viel Erfolg 👍""]",negative
"Y - 20240228 - it will not happen again, proof of crimes

Proof of crime against humanities, #crimesagainsthumanity malicious blocking of dissidents like me, by meta/facebook/IG and mark zuckerberg - I was adding ""instagram's own account"" itself to this account, the same thing happened when I tried to add leomessi and waynegretzky and others in our list now.
the same also happened when i tried adding piinsu, zuweiii_, joannezheng. All public figures in TW.

They were all on my jcl.prdgmshftr and neoclanomalie accounts in the past whom i could message freely. it would appear IG is trying to block my access to the outside world.

"It may be the end of #TeenDatingViolenceAwarenessMonth, but that doesn’t mean that the conversation has to end here. We wanted to take the time today to provide some support to parents.

A common barrier for teens when it comes to reporting dating or sexual violence is that they don’t feel like they have a safe adult to disclose to. They may fear that their parents may get too sad hearing what they’ve been through, or may even get angry at them, blame them, or otherwise become aggressive. The first step to prevent further harm is to create a safe space for disclosure.

Parents, even if your child has never shared any experiences like these with you, it’s important that you are mindful of how you interact with them and these topics in different contexts. Your teen will often think back to your demeanor in other contexts to determine whether or not you are a safe person to disclose to.

Swipe to learn some ways to foster a relationship with your child that demonstrates that you are a safe adult to disclose to before it happens.

"Dans vos oreilles aujourd’hui :
✨ Viens te faire dévalider : Sororité ✨

“Ça fait maintenant trente ans que le silence est mon moteur. J’imagine pourtant l’incroyable mélodie que nous pourrions composer ensemble, faite de vérité. Ça ne ferait pas mal, je vous le promets. Juste une égratignure sur la carcasse de notre curieuse famille.”

Avec ses mots et son courage, Judith Godrèche est venue ouvrir en grand la boîte de pandore du cinéma français lors de la dernière cérémonie des Césars. Ça bouillonnait déjà bien fort depuis des mois avec l’affaire Depardieu, notre monstre sacré devenu monstre ordinaire. Mais jusque-là, Depardieu, Besson, Polanski et tous les autres bénéficiaient encore de notre indulgence collective. Il y a tout juste quatre ans, nous n’étions pas nombreuses à nous émouvoir du César accordé à Polanski. Et la foule est restée bien silencieuse lorsque qu’Adèle Haenel, Céline Sciamma et quelques autres ont quitté la salle en signe de protestation. Depuis toujours, la grande famille du cinéma serre les rangs autour de ses prédateurs.

Judith Godrèche avait seulement 14 ans lorsqu’elle a rencontré le réalisateur Benoît Jacquot. Il en avait 39. Ils débutent alors une relation de “couple” qui durera 6 ans. Pour se protéger elle-même, Judith s’invente une grande histoire d’amour. Mais c’est une histoire d’emprise et de prédation.

"Gym time! The only way to combat this abuse is to show up happy & healthy. I got part of my lunch paid for today by an employee at the restaurant. So sweet! And some dude used his membership code to help me save money on gas at the gas station. Yesss!!! I maybe trapped in extreme abuse but at least I’m happy & healthy. Start my new job Monday. Can’t wait. I am someone who likes working. 

There is a war at home. If only someone knew? 

❤️🤍💙 🤫❤️‍🩹💔

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"Step 1 is not a physical thing you do, but a mental realization.

This is much more challenging than it sounds when you are dealing with the syndrome of being abused and the resulting PTSD.

The PTSD may be telling you that you can do it alone - either to stay with the abuser - or leave without support - LIE.

You need a step-by-step plan to leave.  Comment STEP and I'll send you my comprehensive ""12 Steps to Safety"".

"God didn’t give me daughters. He gave me my best friends. 3 years without my babygirls. Over 5 years post divorce & a lifetime of trauma.

There is a war at home. If only someone knew? 

❤️🤍💙 🤫❤️‍🩹💔

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

TW: deeper details into my experience

Might delete these details later. i am worried how they could be interpreted by predetors. 
.
.

Ive expereinced child sexual abuse from a sibiling from as early as i can remeber till about 10years old. It isnt always obvious.it isnt always an adult. It isnt always a man. It was just normal, it was my life.  I was again then assaulted by my boyfriend at the time around 12years old. I was then coerced and pressured by my boyfriend at the time around 14 years old.  I was then persued and emotionally manipualted into sexual dynamic by a 23 year old man over the internet at 15 years old.  I was then raped by an lgbt+ peer at 16 years old, i didnt  cognitivly realise i had been raped till a year later. It was my normal, it was my life. I was persued by and had a relationship with a 26 year old man at 17. I was raped by an lgbt+  peer in my early 20s (between 19-22). I dont remeber my age at the time as i was also navigating an emotionally and mentally abusive relationship.
.
.
.
I am not ONLY what has happened to me, this is not ALL that has happened to me. But it is a lot, and it has shaped me. Im glad im safe now, im glad ive done the work to discern safe connection.

My story is unfortuntly common.

"🌸 Ma BD de la semaine 🌸
Est un diptyque manga qui nous emmène auprès de Yuri et Akira
🌸
Elle est une adolescente blasée de 14 ans
Il est un pilote de l'armée de l'air de 20 ans
Par un phénomène mystérieux, Yuri se retrouve en 1945. Recueillie par Mme Tsuru dans son restaurant, Yuri découvre les conditions de vie d'alors, entre privations, restrictions, interdits au nom du patriotisme, les bombardements...
Et surtout, elle fait la connaissance d'Akira et de ses compagnons, qui s'apprêtent à faire le sacrifice de leur vie au nom du Japon
🌸
Romance dramatique, j'ai tout aimé dans cette histoire dont il se dégage beaucoup de douceur malgré des thématiques difficiles et douloureuses: le devoir de mémoire, savoir apprécier la vie qu'on a, garder espoir, l'entraide
Bien que la différence d'âge m'ait questionnée, j'ai aussi apprécié la prévenance (anachronique et post #metoo) dont fait preuve Akira envers Yuri, comme les doutes, croyances et peurs ressentis par ces jeunes hommes

"In honor of #TeenDatingViolenceAwarenessMonth we’re answering real questions from real teens who have attended PAVE/Survivors.org presentations.

Today’s Question 💭
Is virginity a construct? A personally defined construct?

Virginity is defined as the state of being where one has never had sexual intercourse. The short answer is, yes, virginity is a social construct. Historically, it has been used to shame others, primarily women, and define their worth as a result of their sexual activity. However, not everyone views the concept this way.

Whether or not you choose to personally use the term virginity is completely up to you, making it a self-defined concept. Keep in mind that we should never impose this on others. For those who do choose to use the concept of virginity for themselves, they may experience additional distress if they have been sexually assaulted. This is one reason why it is very important that we understand that sex and sexual assault are not the same thing. If you do use the concept of virginity for yourself, being sexually assaulted does not mean you have lost your virginity. Sexual assault is an act of violence, not sexual intercourse.

"The mothers of the United States, hereby submit this Demand for Order to Show Cause. This demand is made in pursuit of judicial intervention to address and amend the significant systemic failings within the U.S. family court system—failings that have detrimentally affected the lives and well-being of children and families nationwide. Central to our demand is the call for comprehensive reforms that align the operations of the family court system with its fundamental commitments to fairness, equity, and the paramountcy of children’s best interests.

Through this demand, we call upon the United States of America, the Respondent, to demonstrate cause why it has not undertaken necessary and urgent reforms within the family court system to eliminate procedural inefficiencies, biases, and a lack of transparency that undermine the justice and equity these courts are entrusted to deliver. #familycourt #childrensrights #usa #humanrightswatch #womensrightsarehumanrights✊ #metoofamilycourt #protectivemothersrevolution #usconstitution #uscongress #unitedstates #shadowpandemic #domesticviolenceawarenessmonth💜 #timesup","[""#familycourt"",""#childrensrights"",""#usa"",""#humanrightswatch"",""#womensrightsarehumanrights✊"",""#metoofamilycourt"",""#protectivemothersrevolution"",""#usconstitution"",""#uscongress"",""#unitedstates"",""#shadowpandemic"",""#domesticviolenceawarenessmonth💜"",""#timesup""]",2024-02-28,7,45,0,"[""@metoomoms_florida"",""I volunteer as tribute!!!! 🙌🔥👏"",""Can I join this ?!?"",""🔥👏🙌❤ Yes and Yes!

"Today, let’s shed light on a grave issue that affects millions of lives worldwide: Human Trafficking. As we observe National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, it’s crucial to educate ourselves about this heinous crime and work together to combat it. 

Signs to watch for:

💜 Physical Manifestations: Look out for signs of physical abuse, malnourishment, extreme fatigue, or untreated medical conditions.
 💜 Absence of Autonomy: Individuals may have limited or no access to personal identification documents, money, or personal belongings, indicating a lack of control over their own lives.
 💜 Communication Restrictions: Victims may be prohibited from speaking for themselves or have limited interaction with others. Their communication may be closely monitored or controlled.
 💜 Unconventional Work Situations: Pay attention to individuals who work excessively long hours, reside at their workplace, or display signs of indebtedness to their employer.
💜 Behavioural Clues: Victims may exhibit fearful, anxious, depressed, submissive, tense, or nervous/paranoid behavior. They may also avoid making eye contact.
💜 Inconsistencies in Narratives: Be cautious of individuals who struggle to clarify their current living arrangements or provide inconsistent explanations about how they ended up in their present circumstances.
 💜 Lack of Familiarity with Location or Date: Victims may not know the city they are in, their place of residence, or even the current date.
💜 Suspicious Financial Practices: Pay attention if someone else controls their finances or if they possess unexplained significant debts.

"#moiaussi tant qu’il le faudra !

C’est avec beaucoup d’amertume et de déception face au système judiciaire que nous prenons position par rapport à la peine de 12 mois avec surcis accordée à Francis Saumure, coupable d’agression sexuelle sur une femme intoxiquée. Saumure reçoit une peine que l’on juge non proportionnelle à la gravité et la violence du crime commis.

Comme dénoncé par nos allié·es les CALACS, c’est un « recul en matière de lutte contre les violences sexuelles », explique Kathleen Godmer, coordonnatrice du CALACS Vallée-de-la-Gatineau.

Nous considérons que c’est une violence systémique faite aux victimes de violence sexuelle qui auraient besoin de soutien de la part du système de justice. 
Au lieu de nuire à la confiance des victimes qui doivent déjà composer avec plusieurs obstacles à la dénonciation, brisons le silence pour s’inscrire dans un mouvement qui refuse de tolérer les violences à caractère sexuel.

En support aux victimes, nous invitons toute notre communauté à militer pour faire changer le Code criminel afin de rendre inadmissibles les peines d’emprisonnement dans la collectivité en cas d’agression sexuelle pour protéger la collectivité et ne pas minimiser cet acte criminel immoral.

"Hur är det med den psykiska hälsan hos elever i nian? Det är stor skillnad på hur tjejer och killar mår, visar en enkät gjord bland niondeklassare i Sverige. Killarna uppger ett större välmående. Samtidigt är tjejer betydligt mer utsatta för sexuellt våld och sexuella trakasserier, både online och i verkligheten. Allt det här hänger ihop, menar forskarna bakom enkäten.

De som rapporterar att de varit utsatta för olika former av trakasserier uppger också i högre utsträckning ohälsa. Och ju fler former av trakasserier som eleverna har varit utsatta för, desto högre är sannolikheten att de också vittnar om psykosomatiska besvär, depressiva symtom och självskadebeteende.

Tjejer är i högre utsträckning än killar, utsatta för flera olika former av våld och trakasserier. Forskarna kallar det att vara ”multiutsatt”.

− De stora skillnader som syns mellan tjejers och killars psykiska hälsa är alarmerande och det finns en tydlig koppling till skillnaden i utsatthet, säger professor Katja Gillander Gådin vid Mittuniversitetet.

"เมื่อคนเจน Z อาจเลือกเป็น ‘อนุรักษ์นิยม’ มากกว่า ‘เสรีนิยม’ โดยมีสาเหตุหนึ่งมาจากเพศ

บทความจากเว็บไซต์ไฟแนนเชียลไทม์ส (Financial Times) สำนักข่าวเศรษฐกิจและการเงิน หยิบงานวิจัยของอลิซ อีแวนส์ (Alice Evans) นักวิจัยที่มหาวิทยาลัยสแตนฟอร์ด (Stanford University) ทำการสำรวจทัศนคติและอุดมการณ์ของชาวเจน Z พบว่า เจน Z บางส่วนเลือกที่จะมีแนวคิดอย่างอนุรักษ์นิยม ซึ่ง ‘เพศ’ กลายเป็นตัวแปรสำคัญในการเลือกแนวคิด 

อีแวนส์สำรวจความคิดและมุมมองของคนเจน Z ในประเทศต่างๆ ส่วนใหญ่ค่อนข้างมีช่องว่างทางอุดมการณ์ระหว่างเพศชายและหญิง อย่างในสหรัฐอเมริกา ผู้หญิงอายุระหว่าง 18 ถึง 30 ปี มีแนวคิดเป็นเสรีนิยมมากกว่าผู้ชายช่วงวัยเดียวกัน 30%

ขณะที่ผู้ชายในโปแลนด์เกือบครึ่งหนึ่งที่อายุระหว่าง 18-21 ปี สนับสนุนพรรคการเมืองที่เป็นฝ่ายขวา มากกว่าผู้หญิงในวัยเดียวกัน

ที่ฝั่งเอเชียอย่างเกาหลีใต้ ค่อนข้างแบ่งชัดเจนเลยว่าหญิงเจน Z และชายเจน Z มีแนวคิดต่างกัน ซึ่งช่องว่างนี้ก็เกิดขึ้นที่จีน แอฟริกา และตูนิเซีย งานวิจัยบอกว่า การเคลื่อนไหว #MeToo (มีทู) เป็นตัวกระตุ้นสำคัญ ทำให้แนวคิดสตรีนิยม (Feminism) ได้รับความนิยมเพิ่มขึ้นในกลุ่มผู้หญิง พวกเขามีความกล้าที่จะพูดเรื่องความไม่เท่าเทียม การเลือกปฏิบัติโดยไม่เป็นธรรมระหว่างเพศ ซึ่งเป็นเรื่องที่เกิดมายาวนานจนดูกลายเป็นเรื่องปกติในสังคมนั้นๆ หรือแม้แต่ความเกลียดชังต่อผู้หญิง (Misogyny) ก็กลายเป็นเรื่องที่สามารถเกิดขึ้นได้ทั่วไป

การเลือกตั้งประธานาธิบดีปี 2022 ในเกาหลีใต้ ยิ่งทำให้เห็นชัดเจนถึงช่องว่างที่เกิดขึ้น ผู้เลือกตั้งชายจำนวนมากลงเสียงให้พรรคฝ่ายขวา ขณะที่ผู้หญิงก็สนับสนุนพรรคฝ่ายซ้ายอย่างมาก จนดูเป็นการขีดเส้นแบ่งพวกเขาอย่างชัดเจน

ช่องว่างทางความคิดระหว่างชายหญิงที่เกิดขึ้น อีแวนส์มองว่าอาจมีผลกระทบตามมาหลายอย่าง ที่แน่ๆ สังคมกำลังแบ่งเป็น 2 ส่วนชัดเจน รวมถึงอาจทำให้อัตราการแต่งงานลดลง อัตราการเกิดก็ลดลงตามด้วย เพราะคนมีแนวคิดขัดแย้งกัน อย่างที่เกาหลีใต้อัตราเฉลี่ยที่ผู้หญิงคนหนึ่งจะมีลูกเหลืออยู่ประมาณ 0.78% ในปี 2022 ซึ่งถือเป็นอัตราที่ต่ำกว่าประเทศอื่นๆ ในโลก

Proof of crime against humanities, #crimesagainsthumanity malicious blocking of dissidents like me, by meta/facebook/IG and mark zuckerberg - I was adding ""instagram's own account"" itself to this account, the same thing happened when I tried to add leomessi and waynegretzky and others in our list now.
the same also happened when i tried adding piinsu, zuweiii_, joannezheng. All public figures in TW.

They were all on my jcl.prdgmshftr and neoclanomalie accounts in the past whom i could message freely. it would appear IG is trying to block my access to the outside world.

"“Under min 30-åriga tid som tränare har min resa varit en väv av utmaningar, misslyckanden, triumfer, insikter och personlig tillväxt. Men i början av min karriär var mitt fokus oftast riktat mot att uppnå framgång.

Jag såg mina adepter som en förlängning av min egen prestation och kände att mina egna framsteg mättes genom deras resultat. Men med tiden och ökad erfarenhet insåg jag att det var en mycket begränsad och felaktig synvinkel.

När jag idag funderar över hur denna omogna och även då omedvetna synvinkel kan ha påverkat mina elever, så gör jag det med en otäck klump i magen. Hur många gånger har det lett till vikthets och maktmissbruk på olika sätt? Vad mer kan det ha lett till? Hur och vem har jag skadat?”
(Del 1, Berättelse av man och den handlar om 90-, 00-, 10- och 20-talet)

Detta är ett utdrag ur den pågående initiativet #charyot vars syfte är att erbjuda f.d. och nu aktiva utövare, ledare och föräldrar ett tryggt och säkert sätt att berätta sin historia och på så sätt hjälpa till att utveckla arbetet kring kränkningar, maktmissbruk, vikthets, sexuella trakasserier och våld inom svensk taekwondo. 

Initiativet #charyot pågår till 11 mars 2024.

"Почему я поддерживаю флешмобы #ЯнеБоюсьСказать и #MeToo ? По той простой причине, что я сама была на месте тех простых женщин и голливудских див, переживших со стороны мужчин насилие и домогательства. Я всегда буду восхищаться всеми теми женщинами, которые переступили через свои боль и стыд, решившись рассказать о своём негативном опыте перенесённых мужских домогательств и насилия. Эти женщины не побоялись рассказать свои истории и тем самым показав другим женщинам в похожей ситуации, что они не одиноки в своём несчастье, что не они одни сталкивались с таким тяжёлым опытом, который надолго ломает психику человека, пережившего насилие и домогательства. Участницы обоих флешмобов сделали очень важное и большое дело - показали масштабы домогательсв и насилия в сторону женщин и детей, призвав общество бороться с этими проблемами. И я благодарна всем этим женщинам, что они помогают ломать стену молчания вокруг переживших насилие. 
Мне 10 лет - я столкнулась с домогательствами друга, который пытался меня принудить к сексуальным практикам из порнографии. Когда я разорвала с ним отношения из-за этого, он натравил на меня своего дружка из параллели постарше, который портил своими издевательствами мне жизнь в школе, пока я не ушла после 9 класса.
Мне 12 - в чужом дворе я и моя подруга играли с котятами, которых подкармливала одна старушка. Пришедший туда здоровый мудлоб явно совершеннолетний хватает меня за руку и пытается утащить за собой. Меня от него отбивает моя подруга, вместе мы сумели убежать. Благодарна подруге по сей день, что тогда она уберегла меня от изнасилования. 
Мне 15 лет - я состояла в абьюзивной связи с конченым педофилом, который спал со мной, чесал за мой счёт своё эго и морально надо мной издевался на протяжении года, пока не выбросил из своей жизни, когда в плане ресурсов с меня уже было нечего жрать. 
Мне 17 лет - ко мне подкатывает родственник моей матери, но бросает это дело, когда слышит от меня отказ.
Мне 17.6 лет - родственник отца, желая отомстить моему отцу за то, что тот рассказал в присутствии его девушки глупый анекдот, приставал ко мне и пытался влюбить в себя, чтобы потом меня бросить и посмеяться надо мной. Уберегла его бывшая.","[""#ЯнеБоюсьСказать"",""#MeToo""]",2024-02-28,0,2,0,[],positive

"Не так уж давно у меня состоялся разговор с одной персоной. Разговор весьма неприятный. А началось всё с того, что я сказала, что не стану голосовать за слуцкого из лдпр, потому что он домогался журналисток на пресс-конференции, что зафиксировали их записывающие устройства. Персона поразила меня величиной своей внутренней мизогинии, обвинив журналисток в ""попытках пропиариться"" и полила грязью участниц флешмоба #MeToo - мол, чего они раньше молчали и не заявили о том, что их изнасиловали видные деятели Голливуда. Наверно, потому и молчали, что были только вначале своей актёрской карьеры и эти ублюдки легко могли перекрыть им в Голливуде кислород, если бы они раньше обнародовали эту правду. Потому что такие как эта персона первые полили бы их дерьмом. И участницы флешмоба решились рассказать об этом уже спустя много лет - когда сделали себе имя, стали знаменитыми, сильными и влиятельными. И эта же персона заявила мне - пострадавшей от мужского насилия и домогательств - что актриса Ума Турман сама виновата, мол, нефиг было в номер вайнштейна с бутылкой приходить. Вообще-то насилует не бутылка, не короткая юбка. Насилуют насильники. Так что конченый мусор вайнштейн мотает свой срок заслуженно. Голливудские дивы обезопасили от него других женщин, которые будут строить карьеру в Голливуде. Как говорится, любишь насиловать - люби и на бутылку правосудия приседать. Для меня, если женщина или девочка говорит мне, что пострадала от мужского насилия и домогательств, я всегда ей поверю, пока не доказано обратное. 

У меня есть друг по переписке. Он режиссёр своего театра и звукорежиссер по профессии. Когда мы с ним виделись первый раз, мы вскладчину купили пиццу с роллами и пришли к нему в съёмную студийку. Мы общались, говорили на интересные нам темы и про искусство, пили колу, кушали пиццу и роллы, друг играл на гитаре - мы вместе пели наши любимые песни. Когда мне пора было домой - он меня проводил, чтобы со мной ничего не случилось. Такое происходит, когда два взрослых человека дружески общаются и видят друг в друге личностей, а не секс-объект.","[""#MeToo""]",2024-02-28,2,11,0,"[""Я иногда остаюсь на ночёвки у подруги. Вместе с подругой живёт её муж и двое их друзей. Я дружна с мужем подруги и с их двумя друзьями. Подытожим. Я ночую у подруги в доме, где также живут трое взрослых мужчин. И никто из них никогда не нарушал моих границ, не приставал ко мне, не домогался. Наоборот - всегда позаботятся. Нажарят шашлыков и заварят чай, достанут тёплый плед, вместе с подругой и её мужем с нашими общими друзьями мы смотрим кино и общаемся. Никто никого не обижает. Подруга и её муж с друзьями всегда с охотой слушают, как я зачитываю им мои фанфики. Мир, тишь да благодать.\nТак может быть, не в женщинах дело, дело не в жертвах насилия, а в мужчинах? Потому что адекватные и порядочные мужчины не насилуют никого - особенно женщин и детей. Я оставалась наедине с моим другом-режиссером в одной квартире. Я ночую иногда у подруги дома, где помимо неё живут трое взрослых мужчин. Что-то никто из них не посягал на мою неприкосновенность, не домогался, не пытался изнасиловать.\nНасилуют не короткие юбки с выпивкой. Насилуют преступники.

"Keine Liebesgeschichte – und doch eine der wichtigsten.

Wer ist wirklich die große Liebe in deinem Leben - und was bist du bereit zu tun, um sie zu anzunehmen?
Ihr beruflicher Erfolg ist Noras große Konstante zwischen Liebes- und Dating-Katastrophen, bis sie zu viel der Aufmerksamkeit ihres Vorgesetzten auf sich zieht. Er wird übergriffig, sie kämpft mit den Konsequenzen. Dann lernt sie online jemand kennen, mit dem sich ihr Leben zum Positiven zu wenden scheint. Doch erst nach einer weiteren Katastrophe erkennt sie, was sie tun muss und wer die eine Person in ihrem Leben ist, auf die es wirklich ankommt.

"My name is #PatriciaDouglas

""The Patricia Douglas case is probably the biggest, best-suppressed scandal in Hollywood history."" Vanity Fair.

Take a look at the story that inspired the show and the character of #GirlNextDoor played by @yorkshirewade 

Trigger Warning: Themes of sexual assault.

On the evening of May 5, 1937, a 20-year-old Patricia Douglas was brought to work at an MGM party, under the guise of a casting call, with more than 120 other young women. 

Herded into a large banquet hall, they were ordered to sit at tables and wait. Studio bosses, assorted MGM bigwigs, male stars, and almost 300 revved-up conventioneers appeared. 

Given that they had been promised a stag affair, the salesmen’s lust-at-first-sight response to a bevy of young, over-made-up beauties makes sad and terrible sense. Delegates mistook the girls for party favors and treated them accordingly; without telephones or transportation, the young women had no means of escape. Tricked into attendance, then trapped into service, they were left to fend for themselves.

Patricia Douglas was one of the first people to come forward after experiencing sexual assault in the film industry, leading to a massive scandal that MGM minimized by a smear campaign. In what was a legal first Patricia Douglas was the first female plaintiff to make rape a federal case based on her civil rights.

Age 47

Marie Laliberte was 47 when she went missing on New Year's Day in 1997 in Vancouver, B.C. She grew up in Beauval, Saskatchewan. She travelled between Edmonton, Alberta, and Vancouver, and her resource worker at the time reported that she was engaging in a high-risk lifestyle in East Vancouver. She wasn't reported missing until March 8th, 2002 due to the fact that she didn't keep in touch with her family often, and was described to tend towards anti-social behavior.

"On this day 5 years ago I was a single mommy living a beautiful life with my beautiful children & always having a blast in my aweSome Jeep:

I want to die without them. I’m a natural optimist but not seeing my kids in over 3 years is horrific.  Everyday I lose my kids. I wake up & lose them all over again. I can’t think or move or breath. The pain is unbearable. 

I lost them to unjustified acts of corruption. Took me years after my smooth divorce to report child abuse. A smooth divorce is a bad sign for a domestic violence victim. Wish I had never reported abuse. As soon as I report the abuse they were gone. Best thing I ever did was keep them out of the system.

There is a war at home. If only someone knew?

"💭 ‚Wusstest du schon‘, dass der ‚weiße‘ Feminismus innerhalb seiner feministischen Debatten oft afro-amerikanische Begrifflichkeiten und Kontexte für eigene Zwecke nutzte? 

*Triggerwarnung*

➡️ Beispiele hierfür gibt es viele: Als sich das Hashtag #metoo, ursprünglich von der Schwarzen Bürgerrechtlerin Tarana Burke (*1973) erfunden, zu einem globalen Phänomen entwickelte, wurde er von seiner ursprünglichen Bedeutung entfremdet und nun genutzt, um auf sexualisierte Gewalt und Übergriffe des millionenschweren Produzenten Harvey Weinstein aufmerksam zu machen. 2020 folgte das Hashtag #blacklivesmatter und machte damit weltweit auf die rassistische Behandlung von Menschen mit dunkler Hautfarbe aufmerksam. 

➡️ Bewegungen solcher Art haben einen großen Einfluss auf die Geschichte des Feminismus. Sie erweiterten ihn, machten ihn intersektional. Eine große Unterstützung für die öffentliche Wahrnehmung war und ist der sog. ‚Netzfeminismus‘. Insbesondere an dem Phänomen der Umwandlung von Schimpfwörtern in positiv besetzte Begriffe zeigt sich dies: Der Begriff des ‚Slutwalks‘ (dt. ‚Schlampengang‘) wurde ursprünglich im kolonialen Kontext als sexualisiertes Gewaltmittel verwendet, um patriarchale und koloniale Machtstrukturen zu festigen. Dies drückte sich bspw. in der systematischen Vergewaltigung schwarzer Frauen aus, deren Körper in Folge übertrieben sexuell aufgeladen waren. Im intersektionalen Feminismus wurde der Terminus nun eingesetzt, um auf die mangelnde Sensibilität von marginalisierten Frauengruppen (z. B. von Frauen of Color und Schwarzen Frauen) aufmerksam zu machen.

"In honor of #TeenDatingViolenceAwarenessMonth we’re answering real questions from real teens who have attended PAVE/Survivors.org presentations.

Today’s Question 💭
If consent is given for something specific, but something else happens under that “permission,” what should you do in the moment?

One of our pillars of consent is the concept that consent is ongoing throughout the entire interaction, such as before engaging in a different sexual act, and consenting to one specific thing does not mean you consent to another.

When it comes to responding in the moment, there is no “should.” Our bodies are hardwired to respond to fear, and we generally have little to no control over how our body chooses to respond. No matter what you do in the moment, it’s not your fault.
If something happens to you, or has happened to you that you did not consent to, and you would like support from PAVE, please reach out to our Director of Survivor Support:
(survivorsupport@pavingtheway.net)
or check out survivors.org for information and resources.

"Si replica dopo il sold out 1,2,3 marzo al Teatro Lo Spazio. "" Una quantità di umorismo e ironia, una varietà di toni e ritmi, una tale vitalità che ci si può solo augurare che sia visto da molti più spettatori di quelli che ne hanno avuto finora la fortuna."" Franco Cordelli - Il Corriere della sera-
“Non abbiamo semplicemente e assistito ad uno spettacolo... il pubblico è stato coinvolto, rispondendo alle domande... sorseggiando un bicchierino di whiskey… fino a lasciarsi andare ad una standing ovation con gli occhi velati di lacrime….conferma una grande artista... scrittrice, regista e coinvolgente interprete dei suoi personaggi e del suo ""fare teatro"" che ormai porta in scena con grande successo di pubblico e che noi apprezziamo ogni volta. Dopo l'enorme successo ottenuto lo spettacolo replicherà nuovamente al teatro Lo Spazio dal 1 al 3 marzo 2024”Silvia Scalamonti- Il FoyerTestimonianze sconvolgenti, ricordi e falsi ricordi si susseguono attraverso immagini e linguaggi schietti, una sorta di valzer tormentato dove a ballare sono i confini tra realtà e finzione…l’attrice si spoglia di tutte le sue maschere. Una sorta di strip-tease dell’anima per liberarsi di un pudore inutile e soffocante e, finalmente, urlare le sue verità"".
Marilisa Pendino  - Teatro.it   
...un teatro, per una sera tornato ad essere spazio di verità. Ecco c’è chi passa il tempo a mostrare teatro, chi si affanna coraggiosamente a farlo, poi qualcuno ci ricorda che non c’è modo di mostrare o fare, se ci si dimentica di essere. 
Simone Nebbia- Teatro e Critica 
“Patrizia Schiavo con il suo “Donne senza censura” abbatte il muro del silenzio, delle ipocrisie e del perbenismo di una società che ci vuole solo a determinate condizioni."" 
Chiara di Pietro - Saltinaria
“Attrice intensa e fortemente evocativa, espande le sue emozioni e contagia il pubblico. Lo fa ridere, commuovere, lo punzecchia anche, senza mai lasciarlo indifferente. Assieme alle due bravissime colleghe mette in scena uno spettacolo…assolutamente da vedere sia per il tema trattato che per la straordinaria performance.”

"🎤Dénoncer, c’est aussi ne pas être cru

Les femmes ayant subi des violences conjugales, qu’elles soient physiques, psychologiques ou sexuelles, ne sont pas toujours crues.

Des personnes peuvent remettre en cause leur parole, qu’elle fasse partie de leur propre entourage ou de l’entourage de l’agresseur.

Mon conseil est le suivant, c’est ok de ne pas être cru par tout le monde, c’est scandaleux, c’est vrai, mais c’est ok.

Impossible de convaincre tout le monde sur la véracité de votre parole, inutile de gaspiller votre énergie en tentant en vain de convaincre ces personnes. Inutile de vous défendre dans le vide, ou de chercher à prouver que vous ne mentez pas, que vous avez raison.

Si ces personnes ne vous soutiennent pas, cela en dit long sur l’intérêt qu’elles vous portent. Elles ont fait le choix de soutenir l’agresseur, de ne pas vous croire et c’est ok.

Pour le bien de votre santé mentale, laissez les remettre en cause votre parole, LOIN DE VOUS, laissez les raconter toutes sortes d’histoires fictives, salir votre réputation, mais TRÈS LOIN DE VOUS.

Vous ne pouvez pas contrôler la bêtise humaine, la méchanceté gratuite, mais vous pouvez vous en éloignez, en prenant vos distances avec ces personnes, qui vraisemblablement ne veulent absolument pas votre bien.

Cela peut être difficile, mais prenez de la hauteur, toutes les agitations autour de vous ne nécessitent pas forcément votre réaction. Préservez votre paix.

Vous avez heureusement autour de vous des personnes qui vous croient, des personnes qui vous aiment sincèrement et vous soutiennent dans vos démarches, concentrez vous sur ces personnes et laisser aller les autres TRÈS LOIN DE VOUS.

Avec toute ma bienveillance 💜

"✨Unbound - Tarana Burke✨ 

📚 one sentence summary
Memoir of the #MeToo Founder #TaranaBurke .

✨Favorite Quote✨
„…and I wondered how that body that holds so much pain could also hold so much joy.” Tarana about Maya Angelou

I don’t know what I expected but I didn’t expect THIS. Wow. My heart was shattering into million pieces reading about her experiences and the experiences of the other million girls and women she encountered. She deserves all the recognition and respect for all the work she has done and is still doing to this day.

This book gave me a deeper understanding about the creation of the #MeTooMovement and how it all started and why.
Originally it was meant to empower Black and Brown Girls and to encourage them to share their stories and connect with others who endured the same trauma. 
To this day Black women are at a higher risk of sexual assault, as nearly 1 in 5 BW are survivors of rape (www.nbwji.com) 

The topics are heavy but it needs to be talked about. 
If you enjoy #Memoirs I would highly recommend to put this one on your list. Please make sure to check all the #TriggerWarnings .

The last week has been particularly hard, draining. A lot of memories are bogging down my mind, even in my dreams.

The only thing I can do for myself is follow through with the healthy ways I learned to cope.

I’ve been reminding myself that I am now safe and free from the past. 

I’ve been getting to bed early and getting rest.

"Anna tells her story of teen dating violence when, as a freshman, she was “instantly hooked” by a varsity athlete who made her feel great—until he didn’t. Read Anna’s story via our highlights or linktree. 

Looking back on her traumatic experience, Anna @feelinghealingenhanced wants others to recognize the warning signs of teen dating and how to get help. She recommends the @sashclubs “Teen Dating Violence” Power Topic presentation, via our Power Topics highlight or linktree. 

Anna, like many survivors of abuse by male athletes, found it pointless to report because the school ignored victims. If Anna’s school had taken the proper steps to support reporting students, she could have avoided years of trauma. Schools must create a safe environment for all students, take reports compassionately, and act quickly to stop the harassment.

Perry’s words echoed in my mind, unlocking a profound understanding of my own past. In that moment, his voice became my voice, offering a glimmer of hope in the midst of my darkest struggles. His courage inspires us to confront our own shadows, embrace vulnerability, and stand in solidarity with survivors. Perry’s story is not just one of survival; it is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring power of hope. I have never crossed paths with Tyler Perry, yet his impact on my life is profound. He was the beacon of hope that illuminated my path, for which I will always be grateful.

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"🔍 Neste momento decisivo para os direitos das mulheres e a igualdade de gênero, é essencial reconhecer a influência que nossas vozes e votos podem ter no cenário político. Este carrossel explora a crescente divisão de opiniões entre gêneros na política, um fenômeno que não se limita a uma região, mas é observado globalmente. À medida que nos deparamos com desafios significativos aos direitos femininos, é mais importante do que nunca estar informado e engajado.

🌍 Da divisão ideológica evidenciada entre jovens mulheres e homens à influência do movimento #metoo, passando pela forma como a internet e as redes sociais moldam nossas percepções, este carrossel busca iluminar as nuances dessa questão complexa. Em Portugal, a tendência de votos reflete uma inclinação feminina para políticas que promovem a igualdade e protegem nossos direitos, contrastando com a ascensão de movimentos que buscam reverter essas conquistas.

"Почему я поддерживаю флешмобы #ЯнеБоюсьСказать и #MeToo ?
Продолжение прошлого поста.
Мне 19 - я пережила насильственный вывоз в лес с последующим иŠnaṣïlovãnľêm. Во время этого кошмара я мысленно молилась о том, чтобы меня не убили и не прикопали в том лесу. Или не сделали со мной всё то же самое, что и с Дзюнко Фурутой. 
При этом, добравшись до моего района, я ещё по телефону непринуждённо врала матери, что со мной всё в порядке, в полицию я не обращалась - чтобы не пришлось ретравматизироваться, рассказывая чужим скептично настроенным мужчинам о том, что со мной сделал тот ублюдок. 
Мне 21. На тот момент муж моей родственницы домогался меня и пытался подсадить на нар🐈‍⬛🐈🐱ки. Я ничего и никому не сказала, потому что он был тогда в моей семье на хорошем счету. Наиболее вероятен был бы исход, что он вывернул бы всё в свою пользу и выставил лгуньей меня, в итоге виноватой бы осталась я. Моя родственница в ту пору ему доверяла и любила его. Причём во время приставаний ко мне он имел сволочизм и наглость мне лгать, что моя родственница якобы сама ему изменила, чтобы оправдать своё скотство. 
И это ещё не все всратые истории о мужчинах из моего арсенала всратых историй на реальных событиях.","[""#ЯнеБоюсьСказать"",""#MeToo""]",2024-02-28,0,6,0,[],negative

"Me sentí culpable durante tanto tiempo, tuve que luchar tanto para poder contarlo, que ahora nadie podrá parar este fuego que arde por mis adentros para acabar con esta lacra, que nos persigue y además nos esconde, que se considera ""tabú"". Todos esos prejuicios fueron los que alimentaron mi silencio, las amenazas y ""juegos"" de mi agresor, las personas que cuando comencé a contarlo decían ""¿pero cómo va a ser eso verdad?"", ""eso suena a fantasioso""... A veces estas palabras entran en mi cabeza y mi ansiedad empieza a apoderarse de mi, de mis pensamientos, de mi vida. A veces siento que no puedo y sin embargo, cada día saco una sonrisa, cada mañana lucho  para poder salir de la cama y las duchas se sienten eternas intentando lavar un cuerpo que se siente demasiado sucio...

Very important call to action: 

Om was murdered by his father in 2023 at the age of 16 years old. There is an incredible amount of opposition, the AFCC (the hub of deep corruption) is actively opposing this law. In our humble opinion, the unscrupulous professionals (known as reunification profiteers) would be financially impacted by this law. 

We need everyone to send a quick message in support of this legislation, it literally takes 15 seconds. Link will be in [@onemomsbattle] stories: https://rallystarter.com/rally/1763/hb-272-oms-law

"Tomorrow night we open FORCE, a new one-woman-play by @dan_brown_rockaway_ . My friend @_amandaferguson came to see a rehearsal last week, and when we were discussing the run afterwords she said: “this story is so important being told through a singular, female voice.” I can’t stop thinking about her words. This play is about a random act of sexual assault and the choices Sarabeth makes in the wake of her healing. So often when these stories are told, even though demonized, we still hear the male voice. He’s still on the stage, taking up space. We still get the other side of the story. I never thought about how powerful it is to hear this story, through one voice, one girl, one truth. When I said yes to being on stage for a whole play all by myself…I never realized I would be saying yes to putting heart to the voices of so many women who need these stories told without the other side. I’m not alone up there afterall. I hope you come to see this play. Opening night is sold out, but we still have a few tickets left for Friday-Sunday. 🎟️ link in bio.

"Jag har läst ”Allt som var mitt - historien som inte får berättas” av Cissi Wallin 

Boken där Cissi berättar om övergreppet hon utsattes för som ung och hur det har påverkat hennes liv. Hur hon upptäckte att många andra kvinnor blivit utsatta av samma man men som skrämts till tystnad. 
När metoo kom till Sverige vågade Cissi tillslut gå ut och berätta vad hon utsatts för och av vem vilket resulterade i att hon åtalades och dömdes för förtal. Justitiekanslern Mari Heidenborg åtalade Cissi och ville att den här boken skulle konfiskeras. Tack och lov vann Cissi och hon gav tillslut ut den på eget förlag då inget bokförlag vågade att ge ut den. 

Vi läste den här boken i vår bokcirkel. Den öppnade mina ögon ett snäpp till för hur män med makt inte drar sig för att utnyttja den, gärna med kvinnor som de har under sig i hierarkin eftersom de sällan vågar anmäla dem. Om rättsväsendet som sviker kvinnorna som blivit våldtagna. Om advokaterna som skrämmer kvinnorna till tystnad. 
#metoo lyfte en oerhört viktig fråga och ledde bl.a. till att vi nu har en samtyckeslag även om den fortfarande inte fungerar som den borde. 
Vi måste uppfostra våra söner till att bli bättre än detta!

"Over in America, there has been increasing hateful legislation against transgender people proposed and implemented. Such legislation enables and perpetuates hate crimes, including those against children. 

Earlier this month, Nex Benedict, a 16 year old non-binary student and member of the Choctaw nation was brutally attacked in the bathroom at school by their classmates, who had been bullying them for their gender identity. The school didn’t call an ambulance or report the incident to police, and suspended Nex. They died the next day.

Trans people around the world face dangerous transphobia. They face high rates of abuse and assault, and higher barriers to support. This is not just an American problem; it is also the case here in Australia. 

Children deserve safety. Trans people deserve safety. 

Rest in peace, Nex 🩷🤍🩵

"Only my third book for 2024, as she has been in a reading SLUMP. 5/5⭐️

I have been putting off this read, because I was scared to see myself in its pages. Sometimes it is shamefully easier to close your ears and hearts to survivors and their stories, because to sit with them in their pain can be challenging. I had to take breaks during this, but I am glad I read it. Beautifully written, incredibly strong and sad, and angry, and hopeful.

“ How much was I expected to take, to absorb and ignore, while they yelled and clicked their tongues, so freely, with no fear of being confronted. Was I stubborn for wanting to walk, was I asking too much?”

Join us for a conversation about the weaponization of #defamation lawsuits against survivors of sexual violence. 

PANELISTS: 
🔸️ Dr. Mandi Gray (Trent University), assistant professor & anti-violence activist. Author of ""Suing for Silence: Sexual Violence and Defamation"".

🔸️Anju Fujioka, sexual assault lawyer & LISA supervising lawyer.

Moderated by Chanèle Rioux-McCormick, lawyer, McKenzie Lake & LISA co-founder

🎟 FREE ADMISSION. RSVP to the event for your chance to win a free signed copy of the book! LINK IN BIO

🍕 Light refreshments served.

ABOUT THE BOOK: The arrival of the #MeToo movement was long overdue, putting sexual violence in the spotlight and opening up public discussion of the problem. It also sparked a global anti-feminist backlash. In Suing for Silence, Mandi Gray critically examines how abusive men use defamation lawsuits as a weapon against anyone who attempts to hold them accountable. 

There will be an opportunity for audience Q&A and a meet and greet with the author.

We will be accepting cash donations at the event to help support LISA.

"🐍【美杜莎的 #MeToo運動 】🐍

去年台灣不斷出現的 #MeToo 議題
不知道爸爸媽媽是否有找機會好好跟孩子們聊聊呢?

我們與孩子介紹了 #性暴力 與 #MeToo運動 
🚪🚪🚪傳送門>>> https://reurl.cc/OGeOGv
也藉由希臘神話故事，說明被害者常遇到的處境:

美杜莎被侵犯後不是受到保護
而是社會滿滿的敵意與嘲諷
最終使她失去對社會的信任

而侵犯她的是地位極高的海王波塞頓
嘲諷她的是家人與敬愛的雅典娜

所以，當別人需要幫助時
如不能幫忙，至少不要當加害者二次傷害
自己碰到問題時
在安全的情況下也一定要尋求幫助

對爆料者多些溫暖
世界也許會不同

Aino. Aino-Neito. Aino-Sisko. Aino-Tytär. Kalevalan kaunis nainen, joka hukuttautui sillä ei halunnut naimisiin sen kanssa, joka hänelle annettiin. Teki kuolemasta kauniin, karun ja koskettavan & jätti jäljen kertomukseen Kalevalassa, tämänkin päivän puheissa ja ajankohtaisissa ankeuksissa. 
 
” Neito Aino,
Aino-neito hukuttautuu
vaimoksi tahdo ei,
siksi henkensä hukuttaen vei,
ei tahdota turvata tutisevaa,
ei saapua suojaksi sopenkululle,
itkien kotiin vie,
oli alla mikä tahansa tie,
ainoasta alun saanut,
naisen, neidon, siskon luonut,
oman taulun Aino Ateneumiin saanut,
kulkee kun metsässä,
istuu kiven kärjessä,
mukana maasta veteen uppoaa,
kanssa sen hukuttautuu,
itkee koska ei tahdo naimisiin,
nyt kyyneleet sekoittuvat veden viemisiin,
tahtoo hän kanssa kalojen hääjuhliin ”
Emmi-Reetta <3

” Kasvo, neito, minussa mielin, Älä muissa nuorissoissa, Nuorisossa kaunihissa, Kasvos kaioisa somissa, Veny verka vaattehissa. ”
- Hirttäytyneen neidon runosta, ” Anni tytti, Aino neiti ”

” Sitä itken sen igäni sekä puolen polviani kun annoin ainavon sisären turjuksella lurjuksella tuolla vanhal Väinämöisel lusikoita pesemähän astioita korjailemahan. ”
- Runo Kalevalasta & ainoasta sisaresta 

Miun mielestä tähänkin päivään, niinkuin joka ikiseen kuuluu kunnioitus ja kaikki kaunis kohtaan Naisia, heidän teoksia, tarinoita ja jälkiä, joita ovat jättäneet tänne, tavalla taikka toisella.
Kuten Kalevalaan liittyen Elsa Heporauta joka oli valaistuvan viisas, kaunis & kunnianhimoinen sielu, heikompien puolesta tulisesti taistelija, kirjailija, puhuja, tekijä, luoja, ennen kaikkea ihminen. 
Kalevalaisten Naisten Liiton perusti ja ajan edellä kulki & käveli, #metoo myötä uudelleen otsikoihin nousipi.

”Joka jyrinää kadulta luulin isän askeleiksi, jokaista porraskäytävästä isäni ääneksi. Torkahdellessani lyhyihin unenpätkiin heräsin yöllä monta kertaa itkuun _ aina oli tulevinaan joku paha mies päälleni.

"I deleted a lot. I even had my ex pistol whipping me infront of the baby & I deleted it. Something’s don’t belong on film. I’m not ashamed or mad at myself anymore for deleting it. I never want to see or hears those sounds & screams & cries ever again.

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"We confront the unfortunate  reality that for every 15 Black women who endure the trauma of rape, only 1 feels empowered to report her assault. 

This disparity underscores the systemic barriers and pervasive stigma that hinder survivors from seeking justice and support. It’s a reminder of the urgent need to dismantle structures of oppression and cultivate a culture of belief, support, and empowerment for all survivors. 

We stand with those silenced by fear and systemic injustice, committed to amplifying their voices and advocating for systemic change. Together, we strive for a world where every survivor feels safe, heard, and valued 💙

They were all on my jcl.prdgmshftr and neoclanomalie accounts in the past whom i could message freely. it would appear IG is trying to block my access to the outside world.

"The #MeToo movement has put sexual harassment in the spotlight, but it is definitely not a new occurrence.

In a nationwide study conducted by the UC San Diego Center on Gender Equity and Health, 81% of women reported experiencing some form of sexual harassment and/or assault in their lifetime. 38% of these women reported the offenses happening in their workplace or school.

Being the victim of sexual harassment in the workplace can have a devastating impact mentally and emotionally on a person. No one should have to face the burdens of workplace harassment alone.

"Relationships aren't set in stone, they can shift and evolve over time. While healthy relationships can bring us closer, unhealthy ones may start to exhibit concerning behaviours such as threats, control, or even physical aggression. 

These signs can sometimes be subtle, masked by the initial excitement of a new connection. Here are some signs of a healthy relationship and red flags that indicate potential issues. 

Remember, while relationships naturally evolve, they should never compromise your safety or independence. Healthy relationships are built on respect, open communication, and mutual understanding.

本篇為騎腳踏車被機車騎士乘機猥褻的朋友
投稿分享作筆錄的經驗

：「我很不幸也很幸運，我被摸屁股後面一段就是派出所，我有記得車號、安全帽顏色、車色、車型，所以有找到對方、監視器有拍到，已報警、提告。

但真的過程太煎熬了，我目前還沒有辦法再重述我遇到的事情⋯⋯ 真的是夢魘，不想再回想，我現在騎腳踏車還是會害怕別人靠近⋯⋯」

"Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault 

We continue to honor Black History Month by highlighting Tarana Burke founder of the #MeTooMovement in 2006 to support women who have experienced sexual assault. Through sharing her own experience Burke helped other women, especially black, share their stories and help a movement that encourages an end to sexual assault

"Le molestie online si fanno sempre più sofisticate e pericolose, soprattutto per i giovanissimi. Secondo un sondaggio, il 59% degli adolescenti statunitensi ha avuto almeno un’esperienza diretta di molestie online.
Nel corso del tempo, le piattaforme hanno promesso interventi più o meno risolutori, che però si sono rivelati inefficaci.
Si è parlato di verificare l’età dell’utente tramite carta di credito o documento d’identità, o con il riconoscimento facciale; ma un bambino può usare le carte di credito o d’identità che trova in casa, e i sistemi di riconoscimento facciale potrebbero non calcolare bene l’età.
Anche i meccanismi di parental control sono facili da aggirare: su Instagram per esempio molti minori hanno aperto account business per evitare la verifica dell’età. 
Peccato che quel tipo di profilo sia di default visibile a tutta la comunità online. 
E le minacce non sono solo nei social. 
EpicGames, casa produttrice del famosissimo videogioco Fortnite, è stata multata per aver raccolto i dati dei videogiocatori minorenni e averli indotti a fare acquisti in Rete senza verificare che ci fosse la supervisione di un genitore.
Una cosa è certa: i minori continuano a vedere contenuti inappropriati e a subire molestie e tentativi di adescamento, quindi le misure adottate dalle piattaforme sono più una facciata che un meccanismo di protezione funzionante.
Fintanto che non si avrà la piena – e reale – collaborazione da parte delle Big Tech, le norme rischiano di rimanere inapplicate.

妨害性自主罪屬告訴乃論的狀況
包括配偶間的「強制猥褻」及「強制性交」
也就是說即便結婚了，請依然尊重另一半的性自主權
真的不想的時候不要勉強人家！

⚠️如果只是伴侶關係，沒有登記結婚、非配偶關係
違反對方意願進行強制猥褻及強制性交
都屬非告訴乃論罪哦

另外未滿18歲對未滿16歲之人進行準強制性交/猥褻
屬就學期間常有的性侵、性猥褻案
雖然是告訴乃論、採不告不理原則
還是希望校園間能落實完善的性教育及性別教育
如此一來才能盡可能避免憾事發生

"Book 5 of 2024: Last year I read (and loved) “The Husbands” by Chandler Baker, and after that I added this book to my TBR. This book is “Big Little Lies” plus the #MeToo movement. A group of women in an office with their secrets, a spreadsheet of sexual offenders, mothers working full-time jobs and raising kids. The last element was common from The Husbands and I am a fan of how Chandler Baker describes the experience in such a universal language. 
I am not too fond of non-linear storytelling generally, and this book relies on that a lot to keep the secrecy about certain events. Blame it on my worldliness or the predictability of the story, I was able to figure out the “secrets” before these unraveled on the pages. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the book. 
The story seemed very regular to me, but it deserves telling because I am sure this is only a woman’s experience. There are still people (read: men AND women) who refuse to believe women when they are sexually harassed. In fact, this book shows the mental dilemma of one of the central characters when one of her work friends expects her support against a senior, while she is debating why she was never harassed at work. 
The book has universal truth bombs about harassment at work across departments, socio-economic strata, and industries. The female friendships, seemingly unconditional, are not all rosy in this book. These are real, imperfect women with betrayals, jealousies, and other myriad human emotions towards other women. 
Overall, an entertaining book which kept me invested in the imperfect characters and their pursuits.

"CW: Sexual abuse, harassment, coercion, retaliation

A recent lawsuit has been filed against Disney by an employee, identified as Jane Doe, after the company concealed sexual misconduct by former executive Nolan Gonzales, and retaliated against her with a demotion.

She revealed that management repeatedly ignored complaints about Gonzales, allowing him to harass women without consequences due to his revenue-generating role. The lawsuit states that Gonzales assaulted Jane Doe multiple times in 2017 using drugs and coercion, with threats to release intimate videos if she resisted. 

Despite previous complaints, Gonzales reportedly stepped down in 2022 only after additional harassment reports surfaced. 

This lawsuit emphasizes the critical need for large corporations and studios to prioritize employee protection, and the importance of implementing robust policies to address complaints promptly and impartially. Today, and always, we stand with Jane Doe, survivors of Nolan Gonzales, and with all survivors and Silence Breakers.

"• JUDITH GODRÈCHE, LA RUPTURE • 🐹

_ La différence fondamentale de Judith Godrèche avec les autres actrices qui ont parlé, avec Adèle Haenel ou Rose McGowan pour citer les premières ici et là-bas avec #metoo, c’est qu’elle a rompu le silence par la fiction avant même de passer par les réseaux sociaux, la presse et les médias. Passée derrière la caméra, elle a su utiliser l’art de la série télé pour se réapproprier ce qu’on lui a dérobé lorsqu’elle a tourné adolescente. Actrice autrice, elle casse l’omerta avec les mêmes armes et le même outil que ses abuseurs : la fiction. L’offensive est de l’intérieur, la vérité vient de l’autofiction et le salut — encore — du cinéma, meilleur témoin de lui-même.

"Today I was the bravest i’ve been in a long time 🤍

Today I told my mam about what happened to me as a child, as a teenager and as a young adult at the hands of different perpetrators 

My brain told me she was going to respond with blame, shame, anger and disappointment. It turned out that I was actually just projecting those emotions onto her because thats how I sometimes feel within myself 🤍

She responded with love, acceptance and said she was proud of me 🥺 she told me I was brave, that she understood and that none of those events were my fault. She told me she was glad I told her if it meant part of my healing. She said she was happy I told her and gave me a big cuddle. She told me she believed me

I feel like this is one of the biggest steps i’ve taken yet and after 17 years of continuous silence, i’ve finally been able to come clean 🤍

We talked then about my mental health through the years that she lived through with me. My anorexia diagnosis as a teen, the two years of self harm and suicidal tendencies that came in my late teens and my most recent CPTSD diagnosis. She told me she loved me and that she’s proud of how far I have come despite the trauma 🤍

The validation i’ve wanted for so long, but been so scared to seek out🤍 so glad I was brave today 🤍

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"Ce vendredi 8 mars, nous serons en grève. Nous serons fermés, et par conséquent notre permanence du vendredi matin ne seront pas assurée à Bordeaux.

🌸 8 MARS : Journée Internationale de lutte pour les droits des femmes et des personnes des minorités de genre 🌸

Le 8 mars, nous levons nos voix pour dénoncer les oppressions patriarcales, racistes et capitalistes qui persistent dans notre société. Rejoignez-nous dans la grève générale féministe, car il est temps de prendre le contrôle de nos vies ! 💪✊

💼 Pourquoi la grève ?

Au travail, à la maison, à l'école : nous interrompons toute activité productive et reproductive. Nous désertons les lieux de consommation pour mettre fin aux cycles de violence et d'oppression. En solidarité avec nos adelphes du monde entier, nous disons NON aux attaques du gouvernement réactionnaire, raciste et misogyne !

🚺 Face aux défis actuels :

🚫 Stop aux violences sexistes et sexuelles : 1% des viols sont condamnés. #MeToo est partout, mais l'impunité persiste.
💼 Des travailleurs·euses égaux, des salaires décents : pour une égalité salariale, la revalorisation des métiers féminisés et la retraite à 60 ans.
📚 Des services publics pour nos besoins : protégeons l'éducation, la santé et les victimes de violences sexistes.
🤰 Notre corps, nos choix : défendons le droit à l'avortement et la contraception et l'accessibilité universelle aux transitions de genre.

🌐 Rejoignez-nous le 8 mars :

🌍 Prenons la rue, investissons tous les espaces !
🤝 Construisons des alliances locales et internationales !
⛔ Arrêtons tout pour un monde féministe !

"Here are some of the war crimes committed by the Nazi- Terror organization Hamas: 🇵🇸⚠️

💔At least 10 hostages have been murdered in captivity. Those who survived faced starvation, resulting in a loss of at least 20% of their body weight. Necessities like hygiene were neglected, with hostages enduring up to 50 days without access to a shower. Moreover, they were subjected to inhumane bathroom conditions, with waits of up to 2 hours just to use the facilities. Upon their release back to Israel, these survivors were found to be suffering from scabies, lice infestations, and severe eye problems.💔

💔But most chillingly, the returning hostages have reported more instances of rape and sexual assault and rape during their captivity. These heinous acts constitute egregious war crimes and serve as a stark reminder of the brutality perpetrated by Hamas. Such atrocities cannot go unnoticed or unpunished.❣️

🎤🔯🇮🇱While the world discusses justice and resistance, it's crucial to discern between legitimate forms of resistance and outright atrocities. What we are witnessing is not resistance but rather abhorrent acts of violence against innocent civilians. We stand firm in our commitment to resistance through peaceful means such as demonstrations, writing, and the press. However, we cannot condone or ignore the inhumane actions carried out under the guise of resistance.

🙏🌍🎧It's imperative not to turn a blind eye to these atrocities in the name of democracy. History has taught us the devastating consequences of such indifference. Let us uphold the principles of democracy while unequivocally condemning acts of cruelty and injustice perpetrated against the innocent.💫

"🌟She Said by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey🙎‍♀️

Two women behind #MeToo Movement. The journey, the risk and the secrets these two women, together with the survivors and victims took to investigate and unravel one of the ugliest unspoken truth about a producer and his acts. Kantor and Twohey went to great length to give voice to the victims and survivors not because they are great journalist, but because they believe in what they are doing, and while reading this, I know they would go to the end of the earth to uncover all of the secrets, lies, abuse, continuous sexual harassment and clutters of NDAs that were going on behind the curtain. 

This book makes me mad. Really mad and angry at the world. This is one of the must read books for everyone. At least you’ll know how far people would go just for power and to cover up their unlawful acts.

"An Instagram post by an 18-year-old girl from Prayagraj has now led to a trial court in the city awarding 20 years jail term to a man above 60 years of age. 

Uploaded in April 2019 — in the aftermath of a MeToo movement that had gripped the country — her post was a detailed account of her sexual abuse by her private tutor, Sunil Dua, over a few months between October 2013 and February 2014. She was in class 7 then and was 13 years old.

It was her post that alerted her parents to what she had gone through. 

Talking to ThePrint, her father now recalls that as soon as he read her post, they decided to file a complaint against Dua. 

“We did not allow any time to lapse after her post. There was no time spent in any discussions,” he said. The FIR was filed on 14 April 2019, and thus, the trial began.

During the hearing, the father also read out a statement to the court. “If a paedophile is hidden, he can damage so many lives. I told the judge that a paedophile is like a serial killer. He (Dua) was a loner, never got married and he never revealed his address,” he told ThePrint.

"Can we please start showing up as humans? The lack of humanity is astounding. Toxic positivity & spiritually bypassing is so disgusting. Somethings should never have happened. Period. Do better. 

There is a war at home. If only someone knew?

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

不要再要求被害者好好保護自己了

從小到大經歷過性騷擾/性猥褻/性侵害
檢討被害者的聲音
讓發生憾事的受害者們活得越來越小心翼翼
卻發現不管怎麼防、怎麼對自己惜命命
這個社會上還是有不懂得尊重他人性自主的惡人
這麼做只會陷入檢討自身不夠小心的萬丈深淵

最根本的方式就是提高人們犯案的成本
不隱忍、並且讓犯人面對法律責任
真正的保護自己不該是日常活得小心翼翼
而是發生憾事時能堅定捍衛自身權益

希望你們永遠用不到
也希望大家真的遇害後如果無法動彈
無法真的照以上步驟進行也不要自責
當下會突然腦袋一片空白、動彈不得是正常的
你沒有錯

"1/3
Un combat qui n’a pas d’autre genre que celui de la honte.

En 2014, je rejoins comme beaucoup un site de casting à la mode qui promet des rencontres professionnelles et des événements conviviaux pour développer son réseaux. J’ai pu ainsi être convié à un rendez-vous avec un grand producteur de spectacles et de musique. Dans son bureau, je lui fais écouter mes chansons, lire mes textes et lui montre mes photos. Il est à l’écoute et m’encourage à travailler avec lui sur mes projets. C’est pour moi, une opportunité unique jusqu’à ce qu’il me raccompagne jusqu’à la sortie. Là, je me retourne pour le remercier et lui dire au revoir. Il me pousse dans l’angle de la porte et du mur pour m’embrasser. Je sens sa langue râpeuse dans ma bouche sans pouvoir bouger. Je le repousse et le regarde avec stupéfaction. 
Mon caractère me donne cependant la force de lui répondre : « Si vous voulez être un cliché du show business, c’est votre problème. Mais ce sera sans moi. »
Par la suite, à chaque fois que je postulais  pour ses projets, je n’étais jamais retenu, ni convié.
La seule fois où j’ai pu auditionner, le directeur de casting en lisant mon CV, questionna mon expérience : « Tu as sucé qui pour faire tout ça? ». Un sous-entendu qui a laissé des traces. 
Démontrant ainsi que si tu dis « non », tu es exclu ou pire, suspecté d’être à l’initiative d’une promotion canapé. 
Quelques temps plus tard, je travaillais avec un autre producteur. Malgré une réputation sulfureuse, il ne tenta rien à mon encontre. J’ai une tendance à donner ma confiance sans faille, jusqu’à preuve du contraire. Et malgré ce qu’on me rapportait, j’ai également souvent été témoin d’attitudes de jeunes éphèbes, conscients de leur pouvoir de séduction, stimuler les plus vils instincts chez des hommes puissants capable d’exaucer leurs souhaits, pour lui laisser le bénéfice du doute.

"Future; this is to you. 

How can flowers blossom
tress can grow
water can flow freely, without my curious mind?

How can the sun shine so bright,
how can I ever look at nature wondering, 
where do I fit in this narrative?

Yet, why is the ego in conflict with its own home?
Why do we decide to deny, 
when all I we have every done is taken
the fruit from nature,
without ever wondering why should I?

Somewhere down the line,
I know we will find a way to rejoice— 
just as it was intended was our first glimpse with you
but until then,
there are still many rivers to cross
and too many lessons to be learned

"Dr. Karyn Purvis, renowned child expert, would say that every child has three birthrights:

1. There is a safe place.
2. There are safe adults.
3. Someone thinks you are precious.

More than 600,000 children are confirmed to be victims of some form of abuse (neglect, physical, sexual, emotional). The best way to stop child abuse is to prevent it from ever happening. While this sounds like common sense, it really is the most effective strategy to eradicate child abuse.

"La emblemática revista francesa dedica un número especial a la presencia de las mujeres en el quehacer fílmico a través de una serie de conversaciones con cineastas, actrices, guionistas, investigadoras, activistas y críticas cinematográficas galas.
La edición titulada “¡Las mujeres están aquí!” sirve como una reflexión de los avances del movimiento feminista en la industria audiovisual a partir del  movimiento #metoo de 2017, pero también funciona para vislumbrar los nuevos desafíos que enfrentan como género.
El análisis se realiza a través de cuatro ejercicios que incluyen:
-Un cuestionario presentado a 17 cineastas
-Una mesa redonda con editores de la revista 
- 5 entrevistas con actrices francesas: Virginie Efira, Léa Drucker, Hafsia Herzi, Louise Chevillotte y Judith Godrèche
- Una conversación entre guionistas de dos generaciones, Naïla Guiguet y Julie Peyr.
Otros textos que enriquecen la publicación son una actualización sobre los avances legales realizados por la productora Julie Billy; un análisis del libro “Gaslight” de Hélène Frappat; un texto teórico muy claro que cuestiona la pertinencia de la noción de “mirada femenina”; documentos comentados por el Centro Simone de Beauvoir (archivo pero también creación de películas feministas, en particular las de Delphine Seyrig y Carole Roussopoulos); comentarios de los programadores del festival sobre la difusión de películas dirigidas por mujeres y una breve historia de la presencia del cine femenino y de las críticas femeninas en las páginas de Cahiers.
Una edición que rompe esquemas y que se revela como una invitación a investigadoras, filósofas, escritoras y técnicas para que hagan suyas las páginas de “Cahiers du Cinema”, quizá la revista más importante en la historia del séptimo arte.

"Anna tells her story of teen dating violence when, as a freshman, she was “instantly hooked” by a varsity athlete who made her feel great—until he didn’t. Read Anna’s story via our highlights or linktree. 

Looking back on her traumatic experience, Anna wants others to recognize the warning signs of teen dating and how to get help. She recommends the @sashclubs “Teen Dating Violence” Power Topic presentation, via our Power Topics highlight or linktree. 

Anna @feelinghealingenhanced, like many survivors of abuse by male athletes, found it pointless to report because the school ignored victims. If Anna’s school had taken the proper steps to support reporting students, she could have avoided years of trauma. Schools must create a safe environment for all students, take reports compassionately, and act quickly to stop the harassment. Too often schools don’t--so students are denied their right to an education free from sexual harassment as guaranteed by Title IX, a federal civil rights law. 

Use @ssaisorg toolkits (in our highlights) to ensure your school is taking the required steps to protect students.

"Have an interest in learning about the intersectionality of disabilities and sexualized violence? We have just the resource for you! 

Join us on your lunch break for our free webinar, ""Disability & Sexualized Violence:
Exploring the Intersection"" on Wednesday, March 12th, 2024 at 12pm - 1pm. If you can't make it on the day, still be sure to register and you will receive a recording of the webinar afterwards. 

Disability & Sexualized Violence:
People living with disabilities, both mental and physical, self-report having experienced sexualized violence at alarming rates. The exact numbers are difficult to determine, as this intersection is often not studied or researched. Educating those living with disabilities about consent and violence is equally (if not more?) important, as well as the folks that support them. Learn more about this particular intersection, and strategies for educating youth and young adults about consent and violence, in this lunch-n-learn webinar.

"Il faut montrer la réalité. Il faut dénoncer. Il faut être honnête. 

Se battre c’est quotidien. Mais l’indécence institutionnelle et judiciaire nous tue petit à petit.  Certaines y ont laissé la vie, sont mortes de chagrin ou n’ont plus supporté l’atrocité de cette vie et ont préféré en finir.

Les vies de nos enfants sont nos priorités. 

Plus de fête (anniversaire, noël…), plus de vie.

Essayer de dormir, essayer de manger, bosser, payer les frais de justice. 

Certaines vivent chez leur famille, d’autres dans des foyers pour femmes voire même dans la rue. 

C’est ça nos vies en 2024 ! Être une maman protectrice en 2024 et depuis des dizaines d’années c’est voir sa vie basculer. 

Rien n’arrêtera jamais une vraie maman. 

Vos soutiens me font tenir. Merci à vous mes ami(e)s. Merci aux célébrités qui prennent part activement à ce combat contre l’enfer que vivent nos enfants. Oui la génération future. Quel avenir ont-ils ?

Beaucoup me demandent : comment tu fais pour tenir ? Ma réponse «  je n’ai strictement jamais menti je peux me regarder dans un miroir et me dire oui tu as pris la bonne décision tu as porté la parole de ton fils. »

Je suis fière de me battre pour toi mon fils.

Mais cela doit être dit. Parce que j’ai fait condamner l’ASE les institutions et la Justice, car ton placement a été reconnu illégal, t’ont puni pour me faire taire. 

Placé chez celui que tu as désigné coupable. 

Me taire : JAMAIS ! Ps : merci à ceux qui ne m’ont pas cru, cela m’a permis de voir qui étaient les personnes dont je devais m’entourer.

"Knowing what's right and wrong is key to stopping sexual assaults. 

When we learn about respect and consent, we can stop bad things from happening.

"I Like to Watch by Emily Nussbaum. This collection of Pulitzer Prize–winning Nussbaum’s favourite columns she’s written over the years is every TV lover’s dream. Beginning with how Buffy the Vampire Slayer turned her into a TV critic and then running through columns about The Sopranos, Girls, Adventure Time, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, LOST, Hannibal, black-ish, and soooo many more, it’s a romp through the last 20 or so years of television. Occasionally you’ll reach a story where there’s a wee bit of a cringe factor due to stories that wouldn’t come out until later—Joss Whedon is still a geek god, for instance—and despite the actual book being published after most of those stories had broken, I appreciated her just leaving them within the context of their own time. Nussbaum has always been a brilliant TV critic, and it’s rather refreshing to go back to a time that’s, well, not now. Sometimes she’ll drop little things into the middle of an interview that had me laughing out loud—my absolute favourite was the blink-and-you’d-miss-it nugget that Jenji Kohan, the creator of Orange Is the New Black and GLOW, has a pitbull named Gail Feldman… which made my husband and I LOL and decide we’re naming our future cats Morty Sherman, Devorah Goldberg, and Judy Feinstein. But the heart of this book is a remarkable essay that lands smack in the middle of it, one that she wrote specifically for the book, called “Confessions of the Human Shield.” In it she addresses the very thing I mentioned above: that sometimes people do bad things, and the wrong people—often fans or TV critics—get caught in the crossfire for ever having liked them in the first place, something all of us have felt as fans at one point or another, especially in the past 20 years. This 50-page essay addresses specifically the #MeToo movement and Harvey Weinstein accusations, and how the two caused a tsunami that would spiral through what she did for a living—in all the best and worst ways. It’s jaw-droppingly good, and if you only read one part of this book, make it that essay. But I hope you read the entire book, which is an amazing look back at the TV shows we love, and why. #bookstagram","[""#MeToo"",""#bookstagram""]",2024-02-28,0,4,0,[],positive

"""This intersection of women, violence, and purity has resulted in more than victim blaming and the idolization of predators like GGW - the purity myth is significantly changing the cultural and political landscape as it relates to violence and women. Women have always been blamed for sexual violence done to them; that's nothing new. But in an allegedly post-feminist world, where rape and domestic violence are supposed to be universally reviled, arguments that overtly (or stealthily) blame women, or dismiss violence against them, have that much more power. Because who in this day and age would say that rape is a good thing? Or that a woman just got what was coming to her? No one; instead, today's rape apologism comes wrapped in the rhetoric of equality - That's what makes it different, and so dangerous.

In a 2008 Los Angeles Times article, for example, reporter Heather Mac Donald wrote that there simply is no rape problem on college campuses. In response to a Harvard woman's story about being raped while she was drunk, Mac Donald's wrote that to hold her 'without responsibility requires stripping women of volition and moral agency.'...

This insidious argument about 'responsibility' is having an acute effect on the way all women talk about rape. The very notion of what rape is is being debated - and not in a progressive or useful way....

Of course, many women don't call their assaults rape, for myriad reasons - perhaps because of the shame and stigma attached to sexual assault, or maybe they shy away from the word because they don't want to admit something so awful happen to them. But whatever the reason, it doesn't change the reality of what happened - It doesn't change the fact that someone raped them.

As dangerous as Sessions Stepp's claim that there is such a thing as 'gray rape' is her insinuation that some women are too empowered to be victims...Claims like these, and playing with language without regard for women's experiences, have real life consequences.""

Bravo aux lycéens de terminale STAV du lycée de l'horticulture et du paysage de Tournus (71), qui après avoir reçu la petite forme ""Figaro-ci, Figaro-là"" de @leylarabih_grenierneuf , ont travaillé sur le thème des agressions sexuelles et du viol, et ont produit par petits groupes des affiches, panneaux et poèmes, exposés ensuite dans le lycée. 👏

"Malgré beaucoup d'incertitudes, le Sénat a adopté ce soir le texte de ""compromis"" inscrivant dans la Constitution la ""liberté garantie pour les femmes"" de recouvrir à l'interruption volontaire de grossesse. Si le texte est jugé insuffisant par plusieurs associations, notamment en ce qu'il se réfère à la ""liberté"" et non plus au ""droit"", l'initiative est largement saluée, notamment pour lutter contre le danger de la montée de l'extrême-droite qui met à mal le droit des femmes à disposer de leurs corps. Le Congrès se réunira à Versailles le 4 mars prochain pour finaliser le vote.

"Meet-me-Mitwoch
Zeichnungen von mir

Kreide auf Ingrees-Papier entstanden ca 1988 in Hohenstein/SH

Dies war ein Geburtstagsgeschenk an meinen Vater, welcher früher mal ganz viele Öl-Bilder von Clowns gemalt hatte (Malen nachnZahlen).

Die Geschichte dieses Clowns ist, das er sich fragt, ob er das tolle Eis essen soll, weil es dann ja weg wäre. Es ist ein Bildnis mangelnder Selbstliebe und das Leben in folge dessen, nicht genießen zu können.

Clowns sind in der Kunst oft tragische Wesen, die andere Menschen zum Lachen bringen, innerlich aber tief-traurig sind.

Ein berühmter, amerikanischer comedian hatte mal gesagt, er wäre so gut darin, weil er keinem das Gefühl gönnt, was er krankheitsbedingt permanent fühle. Er war depressiv.

"Being hit was the easy part about domestic violence. I say this all the time. I wish he would just hit me but instead my life has been ruined & my kids suffer the most. He doesn’t hit me anymore: he hits my kids. He doesn’t hit me: he terrorizes me. He doesn’t hit me: he weaponizes a system against me to legally kidnap my kids.

There is a war at home. If only someone knew?

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"Filmtipp! ""Gegen das Schweigen - Machtmissbrauch bei Theater und Film"" ist das Ergebnis von Gesprächen mit mehr als 200 Menschen aus der Theater- und Filmbranche. Wir möchten euch diese Dokumentation empfehlen, in der es nicht nur um Machtmissbrauch, sondern auch um sexualisierte Gewalt geht. Ab sofort in der ARD Mediathek und am 11. März ab 22 Uhr im NDR Fernsehen. (Link in Bio).

Drei Jahre lang haben die NDR-Reporterinnen Zita Zengerling und Kira Gantner zu Machtmissbrauch bei Theater und Film recherchiert. Sie haben sich gefragt, warum gerade diese Branche immer wieder Skandale produziert. Dafür haben sie mit mehr als 200 Menschen gesprochen. Bei einigen Fällen haben sich die Autorinnen entschieden, die Namen der mutmaßlichen Täter zu nennen.

Achtung: Der Film kann für Betroffene überwältigende Gefühle auslösen oder überfordern. Bitte achtet auf Eure Grenzen und wendet Euch bei Bedarf an Freund*innen, Familie oder entsprechende Anlaufstellen. Wir sind für Euch da!

"🔴 En unga man som misstänks för en överfallsvåldtäkt vid industriområdet i Timrå i december är frihetsberövad. Nu misstänks han för fler sexualbrott, bland annat våldtäkt mot barn.

🔴 En av de 15-åriga pojkar som i måndags greps som misstänkt för våldtäkt mot en minderårig flicka i Malmö den 16 februari har häktats.

🔴 Efter våldtäkten tog mannen med sig kvinnans kläder och lämnade henne naken i sin bil.

🔴 En elev i Enköping har enligt uppgift utsatts för trakasserier och sexuella övergrepp, bland annat en våldtäkt, av en annan elev under skoltid.

🔴 En äldre man från Kungsbacka kommun har häktats misstänkt för våldtäkt mot barn och grovt sexuellt övergrepp mot barn.

🔴 Under natten mot söndagen ska en man ha våldtagit en kvinna i 20-årsåldern utomhus i centrala Växjö. Enligt polisen skedde våldtäkten på Kungsgatan, precis vid Växjö tingsrätt, efter ett restaurangbesök.

🔴 Mannen förde upp sina fingrar i flickvännens underliv, för att kontrollera om hon hade varit otrogen. Nu dömer Högsta domstolen honom för mindre grov våldtäkt.

🔴 Under lördagen skedde en misstänkt barnvåldtäkt i Malmö.
Åklagaren kan nu bekräfta att det rör sig om en flicka under 15 år som har utsatts för en misstänkt grov gruppvåldtäkt.

Detta är några av de senaste timmarnas och dagarnas nyhetsartiklar. Våldtäkt, våldtäkt, våldtäkt och än mer våldtäkt.
Sätt sexuellt våld och våldtäkt högre upp på den politiska dagordningen! För varje dag läser jag i media om kvinnor och flickor som blivit utsatta för sexuella trakasserier, sexuellt övergrepp och våldtäkt. Varje dag, flera fall, i hela vårt avlånga land och det blir inte färre utan bara värre 💔

The many warning signs are included in our @sashclubs Teen Dating Violence Power Topic (via highlights). It offers a fast-moving video “Dating Abuse: Toolkit for Talking to Teens” with scenarios for people of all genders created by @jewishwomenintl. Thanks for collaborating, CEO 
@meredith_jacobs.

"""A true-life story - a young girl with hopes and dreams left the local city for the bright lights of London - with highs and lows. A true reader rollercoaster! Vicki’s life story - warts and all is an incredible journey. It has made me question stereotypes whilst experiencing the extreme euphoria along with the downright low points of life in this incredible laid bare book.” - Jo 
 
Like so many others, I wanted to escape my reality. How many of us are doing this even today. 
 
The truth of “the Naked Truth” is that I could never escape it until I allowed myself to accept it.

"Stasera il primo dei 4 incontri per immagini e parole che terrò su ""DONNE ARTISTE, nonostante tutto"" 
Una mia personale ricerca su donne valorose che ancora non hanno il giusto posto nella Storia, 
una rassegna di omissioni dell'ufficialità, di ingiustificate dimenticanze, di colpevoli attribuzioni. 
Nominare vuol dire fare esistere, riconoscere è dare dignità e corretta visione del progresso del mondo. Cancellare dalla Storia è violenza, non c'è Cultura se non c'è memoria.""
Gli incontri saranno presso la Sala Consiliare al Castello dei Da Peraga del Comune di Vigonza, ore 20,30
- mercoledì 28 febbraio: Artiste visuali, dagli albori alle soglie del'900
- giovedì 28 marzo: Artiste visuale del '900 e primi 2000 
- mercoledì 24 aprile: Architette e Designers
- giovedì 23 maggio: Fotografe e Cineaste
-Incontri promossi dal Centro Veneto progetti Donna di Padova, Comune di Vigonza, in collaborazione con l'associazione Lottodiognimese 

Tonight the first of the 4 lectures for images and words that I'll hold on ""WOMEN ARTISTS, despite everything""
My personal research on valiant women who still don't have their rightful place in history,
a list of official omissions, of unjustified forgetfulness, of fake attributions.
Naming means making one exist, recognizing means giving dignity and a correct vision of the progress of the world. Erasing from history is violence, there is no culture if there is no memory.""

The lectures will be in the Council Hall at the Da Peraga Castle of Municipality of Vigonza, 8.30 pm
- Wednesday 28 February: Visual artists, from the beginning to the threshold of the 20th century
- Thursday 28 March: Visual artists of the 20th and early 2000s
- Wednesday 24 April: Architects and Designers
- Thursday 23 May: Photographers and Filmmakers
Lectures promoted by Veneto Women's Projects Center of Padua, Municipality of Vigonza, in collaboration with the Lottodiognimese association.

"UPDATE — Ashley Walters v Marilyn Manson

An appeal remittur from the State of California was lodged last week. 

Her case is openly impossible against video evidence but she claims 25+ ‘repressed memories.’ How would a jury take that?

• Repressed memories
• DUI/totaling Marilyn Manson’s car w/Esme Bianco
• Hacking his accounts
• Blaming her for her criminal activity

She’s a 🍑

"7 years ago I was on stage at the Oscars with Lady Gaga and activists and survivors from all of the country! Lady Gaga was nominated for an Oscar for her song that was featured on The Hunting Ground, a powerful documentary about campus sexual violence. 

I am so grateful I got to have this experience. I am so grateful I got to connect with so many fellow survivors of sexual violence. I have made so many lasting friendships from this group and now know so many advocates within this space. I now know so many resources that I wish I had access to as a young survivor—but I am also in the position where I have been able to help allot of people through a similar situation. 

If you’re struggling with the aftermath of sexual violence or harassment, please feel free to reach out to me. I will be happy to connect you with some of the great advocates I know. I believe you. There is a way through. ❤️

Also, that amazing tattoo was designed by my incredible friend @jacquelinetlin 
Jackie is one of the most incredibly talented people I have ever met! Her tattoo design, the fire rose unity survivor symbol, has become an icon for survivors all over the world.

"#Consent is an important and ongoing conversation. As we learn more and continue to grow the types of conversations we have, it's clear that not everyone really has a clear understanding of what consent really is and how to apply it to everyday conversations. Sometimes it's really easy to talk about the idea as an abstract because we can lay out the black and white definitions. Most people can't make the transition to how it should actually apply in real world situations. It's easy for people to get confused and they have a lot of questions. The problem is that a lot of people still aren't seeking the answers. Some of the largest feedback that I've gotten since putting out my book February 1st is that it's making people look at consent in an entirely new way. They are considering things that they never thought about before. It's important we continue to push the boundaries of our thinking and engage in meaningful conversations about consent. Get your own copy and join the conversation. Together we can take the steps to building a consent culture! It's clear that what we've been doing so far isn't working, we need to try something different. Don't wait to start!

Join me on two special musical journeys to honor and celebrate to the strength, grace, and beauty of the feminine divine.

🌸🌼🌸🌼🌸🌼🌸🌼🌸🌼🌸🌼🌸🌼🌸🌼🌸

Ok, now for the full caption… it’s long… you have been warned 😉  As International Women’s Day approaches and I think about the many incredible women in my life—who in spite of their own difficulties, still make space to comfort, encourage, and challenge me on a daily basis—it would be crazy not to pause to celebrate them. 
Looking back, the past year or so feels like it could contain a decade’s worth of hardships. So many heart-wrenching losses it’s hard to keep track of them all—losing my employment and financial stability to a layoff, my relationship and business partner to a breakup, my reproductive rights and healthcare access to a broken system of governing, my physical autonomy to an industry peer I trusted, and worst of all—losing my ride-or-die companion and best friend of 12-years to cancer. I didn’t think I would survive.  But throughout it all, I was never alone. My sisterhood (by blood and by bond) came through like a force of nature, providing the resilience and strength I needed to navigate my darkest days. They were right there beside me, from carrying me through the losses, to celebrating the triumphs with me as I played my first festival and international gigs, released my first EP, and launched my own party series—their unwavering presence and love were my support system every step of the way.  
As 2024 unfolds, I feel at ease knowing that the foundation of my journey is woven with threads of resilience and perseverance by the strong women who came before me and will carry on after me. Here’s to the women who inspire and empower me every day.

"Et hier en fin de journée, Anny Duperey a rétropédalé en publiant ce communiqué :

« Face aux nombreuses réactions sur les réseaux sociaux à propos de mon intervention au sujet de la plainte de Judith Godrèche, et des autres plaintes apparaissant récemment, je tiens à affirmer que :

• Evidemment, Je CONDAMNE toute action de VIOL ou d’abus de pouvoir séducteur - qu’il ait lieu à l’encontre d’adultes et SURTOUT D’ENFANTS ou ADOLESCENTS.

• Ce n’est pas pour rien que je suis marraine depuis plus de 30 ans d’une association en faveur de la défense des enfants !

De même que :
• J’ai touiours défendu ardemment la cause des femmes, à titre personnel et en participant à nombre de manifestations en faveur de cette cause - pour laquelle il y a encore tant à faire. (ce n’est pas par hasard que je fus l’une des premières signataires pour la libération de Jacqueline Sauvage)

Ce que j’ai voulu, très maladroitement, j’en conviens, car il est bénéfique que les victimes s’expriment enfin, après un si long silence, c’est tempérer l’emballement médiatique. »

Des regrets donc, mais pas d’excuses. 

Après cette réponse rédigée par @alexandralamyofficiel, @judithgodreche1 a également tenu à répondre : 

« Non -Anny Duperey- C’est nous qui nous sommes fait taper dessus. Malgré votre égoïsme, votre morale à l’envers, votre ignorance, je ne vous le souhaite pas. Ça fait mal les coups. »

In S5:E7 - Church Cults, Trauma, and Humor  we discuss the dynamics of control and the impact that it has on us, we also discuss the role of humor in trauma recovery. It’s a really great conversation, with plenty of serious moments and also plenty of laughs!

"2/3
Je fais d’ailleurs une grande différence entre une personne souvent mineure sous emprise émotionnelle d’un adulte manipulateur et une jeunesse de 20 ans, alerte et complice d’une relation intéressée.
Ces spécimen ne sont pas rares. 
Aussi, vous n’avez d’autres choix que de faire semblant d’ignorer avec prudence, pour travailler. Plus tard, je rencontrais un autre homme en soirée. Il se présenta producteur de télévision, comme un sesame qui lui donnerait un accès prioritaire à mon intimité. Il essuya malgré tout un refus. Or, lorsque je participais à une émission dont je découvris sur place qu’il en était producteur, ma participation fut écourtée. Une certaine lucidité voulait croire à une forme d’honnêteté et que cette éviction était liée à mes compétences. Aussi je continuais à bosser pour m’améliorer. Mais l’expérience me démontra que cette abnégation n’était pas dépourvue d’un brin de naïveté. 
« Est-ce que tout ça est sérieux ? » dit le poète. Est-ce que tout ça est sain?
Aussi, quand je revis le producteur de spectacle quelques années plus tard, il se comporta plus élégamment. 
Je décidais alors non pas de lui pardonner, mais de m’en tenir à une attitude professionnelle et respectueuse. Tout ce qu’il ne m’avait pas donné. La gêne, pour ne pas dire la honte devait changer de camps.
Pour ainsi dire, il me faisait plus de peine que de mal. 
Aussi le témoignage d’ @aurelien_wiik dans @leparisien est un cri qu’il faut entendre. Il est si puissant qu’il a réveillé mes souvenirs.

"Tarana Burke, @taranajaneen, founder of the #MeTooMovement, is an African American civil rights activist known for her work in advocating for survivors of sexual violence, particularly within marginalized communities, including women of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and low-income individuals.

Burke first coined the phrase ""Me Too"" in 2006 as a way to empower and support survivors of sexual assault, particularly young women of color. Her intention was to create a sense of solidarity and understanding among survivors.

She is the author of Unbound: My Story of Liberation and the Birth of the Me Too Movement, and You Are Your Best Thing: Vulnerability, Shame Resilience, and the Black Experience. Her letter to her great grandmother is included in the book, Black Love Letters, a collection of essays on community, joy, resilience and more.

"Crooked cops might retaliate again soon. I won’t let slide what Andrew Lindberg gets away with. He exploits and sexually assaults an #autistic woman who’s been traumatized by police and would never consent to a so-called “relationship” with any officer. She’s afraid to tell the truth now that abuse escalates again. Lindberg prevents her from running away from Gilead Community “Services” again.

Gilead Community ""Services"" is terrible enough to repeatedly run away from, now a victim is afraid to condemn the abusers as the abuse escalates. She's also forcibly drugged.

Proof of crime against humanities, #crimesagainsthumanity malicious blocking of dissidents like me, by meta/facebook/IG and mark zuckerberg - I was adding ""instagram's own account"" itself to this account, the same thing happened when I tried to add leomessi and waynegretzky and others in our list now.
the same also happened when i tried adding piinsu, zuweiii_, joannezheng. All public figures in TW.

They were all on my jcl.prdgmshftr and neoclanomalie accounts in the past whom i could message freely. it would appear IG is trying to block my access to the outside world.

"My story - Part 1 🙏💗💪

If I'm honest I don't know where to begin, I've been in the the dark for a while facing and healing my past .

I was sexually abused as a child and came from an abusive family.
I was neglected , abandoned and I have pretty much been on my own my whole life.
I left home at 16 and left the UK at 17 .

I ran away from my past and have hidden this from the world and even myself. 
I had not gone through the pain, grief and anger to heal.

Therefore keeping everything inside I created a false self a people pleaser.

A people pleaser to keep the peace, to be loved and liked. To pretend everything was ok to people so that I would be accepted.

When I did have the courage to tell people my story it was too much I was a ""Victim"" and even told I was too dramatic , sensitive or that I thought the world was against me.

I understand that it's not easy for people to hear these things and it makes them uncomfortable , this is not really something we talk about in our society!!
They don't do it with a bad intention, they are not therapists and also when they are avoident how can they have empathy and feel for you if they don't themselves. 
I also get this as I did it my self too I've always been sensitive and have felt the sadness but I never really acknowledged what really happened I did my best not to get in a hole.

Not acknowledgeing the pain,  anger and grief I had inside I just continued surviving creating coping mechanisms to keep going and of course at one point it all came too much for me so I had to go deep inside.

Once I stopped having an eating disorder, stopped drinking and smoking and getting rid of all my distractions I started to heal.

Yoga has been a big anchor for for me.
A tool to ground and accept the process and to connect spiritually.

But it wasn't until COVID and that my daughter came in my life that I was ready to face the sexual abuse.

今天要來介紹的是妨害性自主中的猥褻罪

妨害性自主罪主要可以分為「性交」與「猥褻」
差別在於任意一方之性器是否接合
（包含口交、指交、肛交）

本篇為說明猥褻罪的部分
根據不同違犯對方意願的型式共分為—
強制猥褻、乘機猥褻、權勢猥褻、及準強制猥褻

上一篇鬼故事《藏在水面下的體育老師》
就是屬於權勢猥褻、及準強制猥褻哦

若要對加害者提吿，請務必針對相對應的罪刑提出告訴
假設加害者實際上是「乘機猥褻」
但告訴人為了讓對方被法律重重制裁
而要求檢察官對當事人提起「強制猥褻」的告訴
很可能最後會因為引述錯誤的法源而獲不起訴的結果
那不代表加害者沒有錯、不代表台灣法律只保護壞人

而是法律只保護懂法律的人。

"Are you looking to boost your cause on social media? Share your passion by telling your story! How about the story that inspired your passion? From the days of sitting around a crackling fire and telling your family and friends stories that turned into legends, time has proven that the best way to connect with people is through telling them a story.

In this short-attention-span era it's important to capture your audience's attention immediately or they will move on. I know I do! The best way to do this is with visuals to capture attention - videos/reels are an excellent method to use. Try keeping it fresh with a variety of different types of posts to keep people interested and provide them with something they want to keep coming back to see. 

And did you know this year is all about being REAL? Be real, talk to your audience, interact with your supporters, ask questions, and build a community! When people feel involved and you share your raw passion, it is much easier to ignite a fire. 🔥

Need help coming up with a strategy? Need someone to create some posts for you? Need a logo for your cause? Just slide into my DMs and let's connect!

"A decade ago when I began working with traumatised children, I was taught the concept of the window of tolerance, which aided me in understanding how we can unexpectedly be pushed out of our emotional comfort zone as trauma survivors, and how it manifests within our bodies.

Posted @withregram • @crowdnetwork The Secret History is back with The Secret History of Antarctica!

Following the success of the #1 true crime series The Secret History of Flight 149 (2023 ARIA Nominated for Best Factual Series) and The Secret History of the Estonia, journalist stephen davis is investigating an unexplained death that occurred in one of the most isolated and deadly locations in the world.

In the year 2000 a young Australian astrophysicist named Rodney Marks died in strange circumstances while conducting scientific research on Antarctica. Despite numerous inquests over the years, his tragic death remains unsolved to this day.

As the series unfolds, we learn startling details about the reality of life on the ice; a demanding, isolated existence which, as we discover, can drive people to do bad things. Stephen interrogates who was responsible for the failed investigation, and what – if anything – has changed in the years since the tragedy.

The Secret History of Antarctica: Death on the Ice is out now, wherever you get your podcasts.

"Sou treinador de boxe desde o ano de 1997. 
Em todos esses anos trabalhando em alto rendimento tanto nos clubes por onde passei quanto na seleção brasileira de boxe e, posteriormente, nas equipes de MMA, eu nunca vi um peso pesado que reunisse tantas capacidades físicas e habilidades motoras tendo a o biotipo e a compleição física como tem o nosso Renan Ferreira @renan_problema_mma .
Ou o cara era grande mas não tinha força, ou tinha força mas não tinha coordenação motora, ou tinha habilidades e capacidades mas era pequeno, ou seja… nunca era o “pacote completo” como o Renan é! 
Desde que ele chegou aqui na American Top Team o trabalho que temos feito em conjunto com ele e toda nossa equipe de treinadores tem contribuído sobremaneira para a conquista de altos resultados esportivos. 
Fico extremamente feliz por fazer parte importante desse processo de evolução dele e poder ver de perto as suas conquistas.
Eu procurei minha vida toda por esse cara!

"I haven’t been able to sleep since I got to Houston, my new job & certain dynamics about this have my PTSD flaring up. 

I’ve been going hard on sleeping meds but they’re not helping much. I keep crying, I’m happy & so grateful & blessed to be here & to be  starting this new job soon, but flashbacks & nightmares & just being plain scared of a monster & his unpredictable rage & past history of extreme violence due to coming to Houston during my divorce are hitting me harder than I thought. 

My ex gets really really mad when I used to go to Houston & he takes it out on my kids. He “broke the baby’s face” when I went camping in Houston. I thought he was gunna kill me, kill the kids just I when he used to punish me for camping in Houston. 

I haven’t announced yet where I’ll be working, but he knows for who & where. That scares me & it’s ok to feel things & trust myself. I’m here to get my kids back & start facing my fears. 

Self care is where I’ll be focusing. More reading. Better eating & I’m gunna try to start 5am runs again to help with this PTSD. My trauma therapist said he’s only seen my level of PTSD in 3% of his patients. That’s ok. Gunna stay sweet & happy & hardworking anyways. 

There is a war at home & my children & I are trapped in these trenches. 

There is a war at home. If only someone knew? 

❤️🤍💙 🤫❤️‍🩹💔

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"It is not your fault!!
You're not over sensitive!!
You haven't done anything wrong!!

Narcissists demonstrate a profound lack of empathy, unable to genuinely understand or validate the emotions and experiences of others. 

They view individuals as mere instruments for their gratification, treating them as objects to be used and discarded at will. 

This callous disregard for the feelings and needs of others is a fundamental aspect of their personality, deeply ingrained and resistant to change. 

It is so important for you to recognise that the narcissist's behaviour is not your fault; it stems from the narcissist's inherent traits and dysfunctional coping mechanisms.

"In honor of #TeenDatingViolenceAwarenessMonth we’re answering real questions from real teens who have attended PAVE/Survivors.org presentations.

Today’s question 💭
What should if I don’t feel comfortable sharing sexual experiences with friends that want to know everything?

You’re never obligated to discuss your sexual activity with anyone. It can be difficult when friends of ours want to know our sexual history and we are uncomfortable sharing that information with them. Remember that consent isn’t just for sexual activity, we should practice and respect consent in any and all contexts, including when having personal conversations with friends.

"My aunt lived in that area, and we were taken there daily. I can remember her telling me I was special and that I would be a star someday. That I had to do everything she said. Listen, practice.
My father was supposed to be watching my sister and me, but he would take us there and leave us with her. For part of that time we stayed with my aunt until we could get our own place. My father was supposed to be looking for work, but he would take off with my blood uncles every day, so it got to be that I never saw either parent for long periods of time. That would change on occasion when my father would take me with him to bars while he drank or played in a band or both. I would be at the bar with one of his girlfriends. It seemed perfectly natural to me.
My aunt began to sexually abuse me the first night. It continued the entire time we were there. Months. I didn't know until years later that my sister was locked in a closet while this went on.
Eventually we got a place of our own and the abuse stopped.
A few months later my cousins came to live with us and the sexual abuse started again. Just different people. It ended a few months later when they were caught. They had us tied up. The cords were tight. Not really cords at all, cloths line. My sister and I were tied back to back. My cousins, a sister and brother had already molested us for over an hour. I cannot recall where my mother was during that period of my life. She was gone a lot. I think she was working because he didn't work. That's all I know.

No fue hasta que muchos países comenzaron a manifestarse que los jueces decidieron volver a revisar la evidencia y decidir que serían condenados a 15 años de cárcel.

"Sexual violence is never ok. This includes during wartime.

The UN has stated that they have “credible” reports of sexual violence being committed against Palestinian women and girls by the IDF. Women have reported being stripped and humiliated, subjected to image based abuse, sexual assault, and rape, as well as being threatened with these violations. There is no way to frame this as self defence. 

Just as the UN’s Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict called for an investigation into sexual violence on the 7th of October, the UN is now calling for investigations into these crimes. Sexual violence against anyone is not ok, and sexual violence against one group does NOT justify sexual violence against another group.

"Directors in their 30s should never seduce a female actor (or any actor of any gender), under the age of 20. Really it shouldn’t happen. 

To the young actors out there, protect yourself. Even if you feel attraction to an adult director above the age of 30… ask yourself why you are and if it seems appropriate or inappropriate for them to be secretly dating you. Ask yourself why it’s a secret, and who it benefits. 
I would say to the directors… please do not date anyone who works for you under the age of 20. If you are an adult director, leave the actors under the age of 20 alone. Just don’t do it.Ask yourself why you are interested in a young actor playing a teen character, even if they are 18 or 19, technically adult, but ask yourself why you are pursuing them? Then ask yourself why you feel the need to keep it secret. Power is power. You know you have power in this circumstance, as an older adult, and as a director. Stay away from the young ones. Don’t do it.

"Helpful reminder for a Monday. 

You are not your work. 

You are not the you who is late for work, early for work, enjoys your work, or can't wait for work to end. 

You are not what you do, or how you feel. 

What makes up you is a complex beautiful tapestry of experiences, dreams, potential, loves, beliefs, past lives, future lives, friendships, acquaintances, the interaction with the stranger on the train. 

Big milestones, small fancies. 

But the main message here - you are not your work. 

And therefore, do not fear a Monday morning. 

It is just another day, another opportunity to get to know yourself a little bit deeper. 

And, breathe....

"Many victim-survivors find themselves accused of “causing drama” when they seek support from friends and family. Shaming survivors like this causes so much harm; it not only harms the survivor but perpetrates rape culture. 

Speaking out and trying to get support from people you trust enough to tell is NOT “causing drama”.

"Generous donations from our community have enabled us to renovate another room at our shelter. We very much appreciate your support.

Support of these efforts is both an investment in the only certified emergency shelter for survivors of domestic and sexual abuse in St. Johns County and their minor children and a commitment to help those transition from domestic violence victims to survivors.

Our rooms need renovations and makeovers, and we've asked for makeovers to include paint, bedding, décor, and bathroom supplies. Last year, 325 adults and children spent 28,652 bed nights in our shelter.

Donations to this project will help with the bedroom makeovers and the needed flooring, repairs, hardware, and appliances to create a safe and welcoming environment throughout our shelter. 

With the growth we've seen in St. Johns County, more families need our help than ever before - and the complexity of those needs has also increased. 

If you'd like to help, please call our office at (904) 808-8544 or donate any amount online at the link in our profile, and write room makeover in the comments. 

If you're being abused or have been abused, please call the Betty Griffin Center 24-hour crisis hotline at (904) 824-1555, or TTY users dial (904) 827-0236. Text us at https://bettygriffincenter.org/ by clicking on the blue icon.

"🚨NEW EPISODE🚨

Chloe Wade on Writing for Theatre and her new play As SHE Likes It

Chloe is an actor, writer and theatre maker who trained at the International School of Acting and Central School of Speech and Drama. 

With over 10 years of working in film, TV and theatre she is best known for playing Joanne Grantham in BBC’s Doctors and the lead role in independent film Honeycomb Lodge that won the Best Film at the Delhi International Film Festival. Over lockdown she starred alongside Helen Mirren in The Secret Life of Ophelia. 

She is also the alumna of the Actor-Writer course and is a supported writer of the Sheffield Theatre’s Bank Cohort. Chloe is currently reigning champion of the Birmingham Rep’s Monologue Slam competition with her piece “May I Take Your Order Please”, based on her time working in hospitality. 

In this episode we discuss Chloe’s brand new play that’s currently on tour across the UK, As SHE Likes It, a play bringing to light the sexual harassment that has/is going on in Hollywood and how it dates back back to the 1920s, not just to Harvey Weinstein. 

The play is based on the story of actress Patricia Douglas who was abused at an MGM party in 1937. Despite her efforts to bring her perpetrators to justice the case was thrown out and nothing came of it. I had the privilege to see and review the show with @uppercircle_theatre (review group that Chloe and I are part of) you can find it on my profile. It’s a fantastic piece packed with harsh truths that everyone needs to hear and see to stop this harassment from continuing. 

Check out Chloe’s website and Instagram for more information on her, the tour and how to get in touch.

"Let’s chat about @estherperelofficial turning conflict into connection course.
Conflict doesn’t have to be “scary”. In fact, if two people are both doing their individual work and aligned then it’s simply an opening for a vulnerable conversation. 

My number one take away from the course:
if you bring up a difficult conversation and another shuts it down, it’s their job to return to the conversation.  If they don’t, rinse and repeat a few times before letting them go so you don’t continue having one sided conversations without resolution.  If you shut it down, let them know when you’ll return to work on resolution. When people show you who they are, believe them.  Actions over words though words are telling. 🙌🏻😉🙏🏼

You are worthy of a partner who desires communication, resolution, and deep connection. And steak dinners at home on Friday night.  And flowers occasionally on a consistent date. Know your worth while intentionally dating and pick up a few friends along the way.  Don’t settle! What you seek is seeking you💐 🥩 💚

"Green Flags in a Relationship: ✅✅✅
1️⃣ You and your partner have equal say in significant decisions within the relationship.

"Ce livre nous plonge vers la fin des années 80 et celle des 90. Il nous livre en reflet une époque a travers l’histoire de deux jeunes femmes, Rose et Solange qui se construisent, faisant l’expérience de leur féminité dans une époque où les violences sexuelles sont banales et où « il fallait être libérée mais pas trop pour ne pas être une salope ». 

Elles sont « meilleures amies » habitent en face l’une de l’autre dans un village du Pays basque. Le récit de ce cheminement est construit en deux versions : « D’après Rose », puis « D’après Solange » , suivi d’une sorte de conclusion : « Ensemble ».

L’histoire commence dès leur 15 ans au lycée et se poursuit avec leur entrée dans la vie active. Les  deux jeunes femmes n’évoluent pas dans le même milieu social. Rose rencontre Christian, fait des études psychologie et reste fidèle à son premier amour dans une vie aux apparences, toute tracée. Solange elle, tombe enceinte à 15 ans, sans pouvoir avorter car il est trop tard, et est « sauvée » pour ainsi dire, par le théâtre.

Des vies jalonnées de questionnements, de quête de soi, dans ces années où l’ambiance est reproduite -je dirai- à la perfection : les Rita Mistsouko, David Bowie, la loi Devaquet, le sida. On retrouve tout ! Même « le Chat bleu » à Bordeaux. 🐈‍⬛😉

Mon avis : 🤓🗯️

J’écoutais Marie Darrieussecq lors d’une émission sur Radio France qui disait « On est faite d’un corps et d’une tête déjà et pendant des millénaires quand même on nous a refusé la tête. Il a bien fallu qu’on la couse (…)»

Tout est dit ! Pour moi ce livre est une claque, il agit comme une révélation « Nous les filles on n’avait pas d’outil conceptuel pour penser ce qui nous arrivait ». 

À toutes ces femmes qui se croyaient libres dans un monde profondément patriarcal. C’est sûr, il y aura un avant et un après #metoo 

Ce livre nous parle d’une amitié qui m’interroge car elle reflète plus l’absence et l’abandon que la complicité et la solidarité. Ce qui révèle tout de même une profonde solitude…

"👉L’information judiciaire visant Patrick Poivre d'Arvor pour viols a été élargie à deux viols et une agression sexuelle dénoncés par trois femmes différentes, tandis que les plaintes ou témoignages de 19 autres femmes ont été classés, a indiqué le parquet de Nanterre.

👉""Trois autres faits dénoncés ont fait le 27 février 2024 l'objet d'une saisine complémentaire des deux juges d'instruction déjà saisis des faits concernant madame Florence Porcel, afin que le périmètre de leurs investigations soit étendu à ces faits"", deux viols et une agression sexuelle présumés commis entre 2007 et 2018, a encore précisé le ministère public, confirmant une source proche du dossier.

👉 Déjà accusé de viols et agressions sexuelles par au moins une quarantaine de femmes, PPDA fait aujourd’hui l’objet d’une information judiciaire ouverte après la plainte de l'autrice Florence Porcel.

👉 Plusieurs femmes accusant PPDA ont salué la décision des juges, bien que l'ancien présentateur conteste fermement les faits allégués.

👉 Cette première mise en examen est perçue comme une victoire dans le combat contre les agressions sexuelles, selon l'association @MeTooMédia fondée par trois victimes présumées du présentateur.

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"ENG
This XXIst century is offering us all many societal shifts
Funny I am writing this post in February, the month of carnival which societal objective is that of roles reversal within a human group.
#metoo began with women and cascaded through many different professions.
Let's be clear, it is not a question of profession, but a societal structural one.

Any abused child who could not be witnessed and trusted in their pain remains stuck with loneliness, hurt, fear, shame …within the adult who is carrying them
The gender of the child does not matter, the pain is similar.
What changes is the perception of 
what is a woman: kind, gentle, patient, smiling, sweet, weak, emotional, a mother or a whore 
and what is a man: strong, powerful, a leader, does not show emotions, solid, a knight, a warrior
well, no.
all of those traits can belong to a man or a woman
Working with an adult is working with kids and teens

Thank you @aurelien_wiik to state the reality

Ce XXIème siècle nous offre de nombreux bouleversements sociétaux
Il est amusant que j'écrive ce billet en février, le mois du carnaval dont l'objectif sociétal est celui de l'inversion des rôles au sein d'un groupe humain.
#metoo a commencé par les femmes et s'est propagé en cascade dans de nombreuses professions.
Soyons clair.es, il ne s'agit pas d'une question de profession, mais d'une question structurelle de société.

Tout.e enfant maltraité.e qui n'a pas pu être reconnu.e et soutenu.e dans sa douleur reste bloqué.e dans la solitude, la blessure, la peur, la honte... à l'intérieur de l'adulte qui la/le porte
Le genre de l'enfant n'a aucune importance, la douleur est la même.
Ce qui change, c'est la perception sociétale de ce qu'est une femme : gentille, douce, patiente, souriante, faible, émotive, mère ou putain 
et ce qu'est un homme : fort, puissant, leader, ne montrant pas ses émotions, solide, chevalier, guerrier.
Eh bien, non.
tous ces traits peuvent appartenir à un homme ou à une femme
Un.e thérapeute qui travaille avec un.e adulte travaille avec des enfants et ados
Merci @aurelien_wiik de dire la réalité

"As Australia reels in the wake of another domestic violence related homicide, we really need to address how we talk about these issues. 

We immediately had the press sensationalising the murder, reframing and focusing on it as the outcome of a “love triangle”, a scandal to be gossiped about rather than taken seriously. 

We then had the Police Commissioner calling it a “crime of passion”. Murders perceived as crimes of passion get taken less seriously by courts, as well as the media (as we have already seen). It also overlooks the power dynamics involved with the alleged murder being a police officer who used a police-issued firearm as the murder weapon. Australia has long had a very serious problem with police officers failing to take action against other police officers accused of domestic violence. 

There is then also the issue of domestic violence being taken less seriously in the context of LGBT relationships. LGBT victim-survivors face far more barriers to support and justice.

We can’t keep excusing, enabling, and protecting abusers. 

Luke Davies and Jesse Baird should still be alive, enjoying their lives together, enjoying the love they had for each other, enjoying the Sydney Mardi Gras with the LGBTQ community.

"3/3
J’avoue n’avoir pas eu à tant souffrir. Sans doute dû à une certaine capacité à me relever de toutes épreuves. Mais je ne peux nier que d’autres que je connais, n’ont pas pu accéder aussi facilement à cette résilience. Ils ont mon soutien indéfectible. Le rêve et l’ambition ne peuvent autoriser ces abus. Et même si d’autres s’en servirent à leur benefice, les victimes doivent pouvoir exposer leur plaies sans que cela ne jette sur eux un voile de suspicion.
Hier soir, c’était la grande fête du cinéma. @judithgodreche1 a trouvé les mots en secouant les mauvaises habitudes, les laisser-allers et les frilosités complaisantes puis nous a rappelé à juste titre que l’avenir de notre métier dépendait de nous.
Si des femmes ont ouvert la voix (voie) pour dénoncer les agressions sexuelles qu’elles ont subies (Elles ont eu le courage de lancer l’alerte et de porter avec force cette révolution nécessaire comme souvent dans l’histoire des avancées sociales), elle n’en oublie pas les hommes qui ont dû également y faire face. 
Ils sont plus nombreux qu’on ne le dit.
Ce combat ne devant pas être un énième prétexte pour opposer les femmes aux hommes, il doit nous unir contre ces monstres épris de pouvoir qu’on tolère depuis trop longtemps.

Les temps changent. 
Follement. Douloureusement. 
Mais ils le doivent. 
C’est une urgence prioritaire.

"Ich bin weiß, blond, habe helle Augen, bin in Deutschland geboren und aufgewachsen und alle meine Vorfahren, von denen ich weiß, sind es auch. Auf den ersten Blick bin ich also genau die Art von Mensch, die die AFD hier in Deutschland gerne hätte. 

Aber dieses Deutschland, das die Rechten dort malen, widert mich an. 

Die menschenverachtenden Pläne, die CORRECTIV aufgedeckt hat, hinterlassen uns in Schockstarre. Es ist erschreckend, wie von Hass und Hetze getriebene Gruppen von Menschen darüber entscheiden wollen, wer dieses Land Heimat nennen darf und wer in ihren Augen minderwertig ist. 

Neben dem klaren Signal, die eigene Stimme zu erheben, zeigen die Recherchen von CORRECTIV vor allem eines deutlicher als je zuvor: Die AFD ist keine Partei, die sich “für die kleinen Bürger“ einsetzt oder eine gehbare Alternative zu den Altparteien darstellt. Nein, die AFD steht für ein rassistisches, extremistisches und menschenverachtendes Programm, und wer sie wählt, ob aus Protest oder aus Überzeugung, und stillschweigend hinnimmt, welche Ideologie damit Gehör findet, der gibt damit Menschen Macht, die weder Entscheidungen treffen sollten noch zurechenbar sind.

Wir alle sind betroffen. Egal welche Hautfarbe, welchen Geburtsort, welche Muttersprache, welchen Nachnamen, welchen sozialen Hintergrund wir haben. Unser Wert als Menschen hängt von keinem dieser Faktoren ab. Niemand ist besser oder schlechter, nur weil der Pass bestimmten Kriterien entspricht. Und wer versucht, die Gesellschaft nach solchen Kriterien zu spalten, darf keine Bühne bekommen. 

Ich bin weiß, blond und habe helle Augen. Und ich verachte das, was gerade passiert. Keinen Zentimeter nach rechts. Keine Bühne für Rassisten.

"People endure victim shaming, disbelief, and blame. . 2 men posted on a tread that Suzie Lamplu and Shirley Banks would be a alive today if I had spoke up. Laying the blame for their murders on me not the murderer! But a deeply traumatised child threatened with a return visit if I told anyone. The police and justice system does no better it often treats us as inconveniences, failing to provide adequate support when we speak up. This enables known abusers to perpetuate harm against any child they encounter. Victims are forced to prove their victimhood, bear the financial burden of therapy and treatment, and suffer from stigma and misinformation, leading to distrust of men who disclose childhood sexual abuse when around children. We are the victims not the perpetrators! Stop making out we need to prove we’re innocent in our own crimes and abuse firstly before affording us an investigation.

"Unas manos interpretan, en lengua de signos, las palabras “Se acabó”; decía Spivak que los sujetos subalternos no podían hablar no por su incapacidad física (de la que sí disponían) sino por su estatus en el margen, sin capacidad de enunciarse o nombrarse. Spivak hablaba de ese espacio en blanco entre las palabras que, si bien no tiene sonido, tiene entidad y existe, aunque permanezca en silencio. De la misma forma, estas manos interpretan un mensaje que es global, que se hizo viral en 2017 con un #MeToo y un #TimesUp pero que sigue vigente con un #SeAcabó que es también internacional. Un grito concentrado en unas manos precisas.

.

Some hands interpret, in sign language, the words ""It's over""; Spivak said that subaltern subjects could not speak not because of their physical incapacity (which they did have) but because of their status on the margin, without the capacity to enunciate or name themselves. Spivak spoke of that blank space between words that, although it has no sound, has an entity and exists, even if it remains silent. In the same way, these hands interpret a message that is global, that went viral in 2017 with a #MeToo and a #TimesUp but that remains valid with a #SeAcabó that is also international. A cry concentrated in precise hands.

"[FORMATION] Intervention sur les Violences Sexistes et Sexuelles (VSS)

🌟 Un immense merci à l'équipe de @metoomedia_  pour avoir laissé une empreinte durable sur notre parcours académique ! 🙏

🤝Ces mardi et mercredi, nous avons eu la chance de rencontrer @emmadancourt, journaliste indépendante et chroniqueuse sur @RMC, présidente de l’association MeTooMédia, ainsi que Noémie Luciani, enseignante à l’ESRA. Toutes les deux membres actives de l’association créée en 2021 pour lutter contre les violences sexistes et sexuelles dans les médias et plus généralement dans les milieux de la culture, elles sont également plaignantes dans des affaires appartenant au monde médiatique. 

Elles sont intervenues face aux étudiants du @master.cno.dijon et @masterjourna_ub afin de nous sensibiliser et nous former sur les VSS. 

💡 Les récits partagés, les témoignages, et les conseils pratiques nous ont accompagnés dans notre progression. Nous sommes maintenant armés de connaissances plus précises au sujet des VSS, mais aussi d'une nouvelle perspective sur notre responsabilité en tant que communicants et journalistes. 🌈

👏 Encore merci pour cette expérience humaine pleine d’empathie et riche en apports pratiques. Il est important de partager ce message et de faire prendre conscience au plus grand nombre des enjeux sociétaux que représentent les violences sexistes et sexuelles.

The PoSH Act was put into effect to shield women from sexual harassment at work and to prevent it from happening, providing a safe atmosphere for them to work in. As a mandatory compliance with the PoSH Act, any organization with more than ten employees must set up an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in the prescribed manner to receive and handle women's complaints of sexual harassment in a highly confidential and time-bound manner. The POSH Act is not gender-neutral; only women can register complaints.

"“As this case continues to unfold, it will undoubtedly serve as a reference point for discussions on family court reform, the integrity of child protective services, and the ways in which the legal system can better serve the interests of justice and the welfare of children. The hope is that, through this painful saga, lessons will be learned and meaningful changes implemented to prevent future families from enduring similar ordeals.”

There is a war at home. If only someone knew?

Post separation abuse is a dangerous place. Some of us do not make it out alive. A divorce is only the beginning. After you leave the abuser comes for your children. Family court tortures you & throws you & your children into an invisible cage.

"🌟 Healing Sexual Trauma 🌟

Today, I want to take a moment to shed light on a topic that’s incredibly important yet often silenced: healing from sexual trauma.

Sexual trauma can leave deep scars on our hearts and minds, impacting every aspect of our lives. 

But I want you to know that healing is possible. It’s a journey that takes time, courage, and support, but it is within reach.

If you’re struggling with the aftermath of sexual trauma, please know that you are not alone. 

There are resources and communities out there ready to offer guidance, understanding, and a safe space to heal.

Remember, your experiences do not define you. 

You are resilient, worthy of love, and deserving of peace. 

It’s okay to seek help and to take care of yourself along the way.

Let’s break the silence, support one another, and walk hand in hand on the path to healing.

DM me if you’d like some support 🙏💜
